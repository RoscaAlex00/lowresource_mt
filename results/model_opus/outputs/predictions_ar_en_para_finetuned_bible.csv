الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,The class is too busy to learn about the Saturday.
وفديك ليام، فواحد السبت، داز يسوع بين الفدادن د الزرع، وكان فتلامده الجوع، وهم يبداو كيقطعو السبول وكياكلو.,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"For days, on Saturday, Jesus went to the farm, and he was hungry, and they started to cut the water and eat."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!""",How do the physicists think of it? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.","He said, ""What do you want to do about hunger?"
وكيفاش دخل لبيت الله، وكلا الخبز اللي كيقدموه لله، اللي ما كانش خاص ياكله لا هو ولا هادوك اللي معاه من غير رجال الدين بوحدهم.,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"How can I go to the house of God, and both of the bread they give to God?"
واش ما قريتوش فالتوراة بلي رجال الدين وهم كيخدمو فبيت الله نهار السبت، كيتعداو على السبت، وواخا داكشي ما عليهم لوم؟,Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"do you not read the Bible to the religious men who work at the house on Saturdays, to prepare for Saturdays, etc.?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.","But I'm telling you, this is where he grew up from the house of God."
وكون فهمتو المعنى ديال الآية اللي كتݣول: بغيت الرحمة ماشي الدبيحة، كون ݣاع ما حكمتو على اللي ما عليهم لوم.,"Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.","And if you understand the meaning of the word that you want, what is good is bad, if you don't judge who shouldn't blame them."
حيت ولد الإنسان هو الرب ديال السبت». يسوع كيشافي فنهار السبت,"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.""","When the son of man is born on Saturday, he will be seen in the day of Saturday."
ومشى من تم وجا لدار الصلاة ديالهم،,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.",He went to their prayer house.
ولقا واحد الراجل يده مشلولة. وهم يسولوه وݣالو: «واش حلال الشفا نهار السبت؟» سولوه باش يلقاو عليه شي تهمة.,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""",The man found his hand crippled. They asked him and he said: What is the best way to solve his problems on Saturday?
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?","They answered: if only he had one sheep and a hole on Saturday, what would he do?"
إيوا راه قيمة بنادم كتر بزاف من الخروف! وهادشي علاش عمل الخير حلال نهار السبت».,"A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.""",this is a good job on Saturday morning.

وخرجو الفريسيين كيتافقو كيفاش يقتلوه. يسوع هو المختار من الله,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant,And they went to the prey to kill him. Jesus is the chosen one from God.
وملي ساق يسوع الخبار، مشى من تم وتبعوه جماعات كتار من الناس، وشفاهم كلهم.,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.","Jesus told the news, he walked and followed many groups of people, he showed them all."
ووصاهم باش ما يخبرو حد عليه.,But he warned them not to tell who he was.,He told them what to tell him.
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,",What is the best way to talk about the prophet?

I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.","My friend is my friend, who is very happy with me. I will give him my soul, and he will tell people the truth."
ما غيتخاصم وما غيغوت،  حتى حد ما غيسمع صوته فالزناقي.,He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.,"I don't fight and I don't fight, I don't even hear his voice in the bottle."

وفالإسم دياله غيديرو الشعوب رجاهم». يسوع وبعلزبول,"The nations will put their hope in him."" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub","And in the name of him, he made the people his hope."
وجابو شي ناس ليسوع واحد الراجل عمى وزيزون وساكنه جن، وهو يشافيه، وهكا ولى قادر يتكلم ويشوف.,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.,"And people brought in one week the man is blind, he is sick, he is sick, he is able to speak and see."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس وݣالو: «ياكما هادا هو بن داود؟».,"All the people were amazed. They said, ""Could this be the Son of David?""",And you like the people and the people. What is the son of David?

So they said, ""This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.""",He heard the cheese cheese cheese. What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «كل مملكة كتقسم كتخرب، وكل مدينة ولا عائلة كتقسم ما غتدومش.,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","And Jesus knew how and how to do it: every kingdom is divided as ruin, and every city or family is divided."
إيوا إلا كان الشيطان كيخرج الشيطان، غادي يكون الشيطان تقسم وولى ضد راسه، وإلا تقسم وولى ضد راسه كيفاش غادي تبقى مملكته تابتة؟,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?","If only the devil were going to take out the devil, he would swear against his head, or he would swear against his head."
وإلا كنت أنا ببعلزبول كنخرج الجنون، إيوا شكون هادا اللي ولادكم كيخرجوهم بيه؟ على هادشي راه ولادكم اللي غادي يحكمو عليكم.,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.","If only I had to go crazy, what would you do to bring them out?"
ولكن إلا كنت أنا بروح الله كنخرج الجنون، راه مملكة الله جات فوسط منكم.,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.,"But if only I was in the spirit of God, I would go mad, see God's Kingdom come in the middle of you."
وكيفاش يقدر شي حد يدخل لدار شي واحد صحيح ويسرق ليه حوايجه بلا ما يكتفه فاللول، وعاد يسرق ليه داره؟,"""Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.",How can anyone enter the house and steal his clothes?

داكشي علاش نݣول ليكم: كل دنب وكل كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال غيتغفر للناس، ولكن كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال على الروح القدس ما غيتغفرش.,So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.,"I will tell you: every penis and all the talk of infidels is forgiven to people, but the talk of infidels is not forgiven."

But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.,"Why is it a word against a man's son that he forgives him, but what is a word against the holy spirit that he will not forgive him?"

These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.,"I regret the good things to get the good stuff out of the good treasure that I found, and the bad stuff out of the bad treasure that I wrote."
ونݣول ليكم: راه كل هضرة خاوية كيݣولوها الناس، غادي يتحاسبو عليها فيوم الحساب.,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.","And I'll tell you: there's all this empty water that people are talking about, and they're going to charge for it on the day of reckoning."

But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.","He will tell them: he is an ugly and corrupt generation to ask for a sign, and he will not give him a sign other than the sign of the prophet."

Something like that will happen to the Son of Man.

So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do stealing, false witness, and telling lies about others.","The best way to come from the heart is to take the wrong ideas: what happened to the dead, what happened to the couple and what happened, what happened to the thief, what did he do?"

You will be given what you are asking for."" And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand",And you will have the best time for her daughter.
ومن بعد، مشى يسوع من تم لجنب البحر ديال الجليل، وطلع للجبل وݣلس تم.,Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.,"And then, Jesus went from the side of the beach to the mountain and went to bed."

He said, ""I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home.""","He told him to stay in this room, he said, and he did not eat with me, and he did not want to eat."

Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people.,"They took seven bread and whales, thanked God and cut them off and gave it to people."

وكانو الناس اللي كلاو ربعالاف واحد من غير العيالات والولاد.,"The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.",They were people who were both four thousand and thousands of children.
وملي صيفط يسوع الجماعات د الناس، ركب فالفلوكة وجا لجوايه بلاد مجدان.,"After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan.",I will remind my people that he is a good friend.

وجاو لعند يسوع شي وحدين من الفريسيين والصدوقيين باش يجربوه، وطلبو منه يبين ليهم شي علامة من السما. متى,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.,They asked him to show me a sign of poison.
ولكن هو جاوبهم وݣال: «ملي كتغرب الشمس كتݣولو: الجو غيكون صافي، علاحقاش السما حمرا.,"He replied, ""In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be good weather. The sky is red.'",But he answered them and said: What is the best way to open the sun?

The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now.","And early in the morning, he said, ""Today it will be the first time, the poison will be red and red."" You know, explain the weather, but the signs of time will not explain them!"

But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.""  Then Jesus left them and went away.

وملي وصلو التلامد للجهة لخرى من البحر، نساو ياخدو معاهم الخبز.,The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread.,"They came to the side of the sea, they took bread with them."

وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «علاش آ قلالين الإيمان كتݣولو فخاطركم: ما عندنا خبز؟,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, ""Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?",And Jesus taught him how and how to tell him: What is the best thing to do with faith? What is the best way to eat bread?
واش مازال ما فهمتو؟ واش ما عقلتوش على خمسة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على خمسالاف واحد، وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو من الطروف د الخبز؟ متى,"Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?",Do you still not understand?

He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ,"The hour is now coming, and he is waiting for his head to be taught to the Frisians and the Saddians, and he is not a baked bunch."
وملي وصل يسوع لجوايه قيصرية فيلبس، سول تلامده: «شكون هو ولد الإنسان فنضر الناس؟»,"Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say the Son of Man is?""",What is the best way to find a caesarean?

Jesus Tells About His Coming Death,"and after Jesus gave him advice, he said that he should not go to anything. What should I do? What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?"
