وبقى تم حتى مات هيرودس باش يتحقق كلام الرب على لسان النبي اللي ݣال: «من مصر عيطت على ولدي». هيرودس كيقتل الدراري الصغار,"They stayed there until King Herod died.

(Hosea 11:1)","And it was until Herod's death that the word of God was fulfilled through the prophet who said, 'From Egypt I called my son '."
وملي شاف هيرودس بلي العلما د النجوم لعبو بيه، تقلق بزاف وآمر باش يتقتلو ݣاع الدراري اللي فبيت لحم والنواحي ديالها من ولد عامين للتحت، حيت هادي هي المدة اللي دازت على الوقت اللي عرفه من العلما د النجوم،,Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him. So he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the area around it. All the boys two years old and under were to be killed. This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star.,"When Herodides saw that the astronomer had played with him, he became very upset and ordered that all the children in the meat house be killed, and all its parts from the age of two below, as this was the duration that he knew from the astronomer,"
وهكا تحقق كلام الرب على لسان النبي إرميا اللي ݣال:,"In this way, the words the prophet Jeremiah spoke came true. He had said,","And so the word of God was fulfilled through the prophet Jeremiah, who said:"
«من الرامة تسمع غوات،  بكا ونواح كتير،  راحيل كتبكي على ولادها  وما بغاتش اللي يعزيها،  حيت ولادها ماتو». العائلة ديال يسوع كترجع من مصر,"""A voice is heard in Ramah.

(Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' Family Returns to Nazareth","From the beginning, she heard voices, crying and crying, Rachel weeping for her children and she didn't want a comforter, because her children died."

وݣال ليه: «نوض خد الولد ومه ورجع لبلاد إسرائيل، حيت هادوك اللي كانو باغيين يقتلو الولد ماتو».,"The angel said, ""Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead.""","and said, 'Get up and take the boy and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the boy are dead'"

Warned in a dream, Joseph went back to the land of Galilee instead.","But when he heard that Archilaus was ruling the land of Judah instead of Herod, he was afraid to come back to his father."

وما تبداوش تݣولو مع راسكم: بانا هو إبراهيم. نݣول ليكم: راه الله قادر باش يدير من هاد الحجر ولاد لإبراهيم. يوحنا,"Don't think you can say to yourselves, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.","And do not say to yourselves, 'I am Abraham. '"

وفيده المدرة غيدري بيها دراسه وغيجمع الݣمح فخزاينه، أما التبن راه غيحرقه بالعافية اللي عمرها ما غتطفا». يوحنا كيعمد يسوع,"His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the storeroom. But he will burn up the husks with fire that can't be put out.""

وهو يرد عليه يسوع: «مكتوب فكتاب الله: ماشي غير بالخبز بوحده كيعيش بنادم، ولكن كيعيش بكل كلمة كيݣولها الله».,"Jesus answered, ""It is written, 'Man doesn't live only on bread. He also lives on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "" (Deuteronomy 8:3)","And he answered him, Jesus, it is written, that man should live not on bread alone, but on every word that God speak."
ومن بعد، داه إبليس لمدينة أورشليم المقدسة، ووقفه على بلاصة عالية فوق بيت الله،,Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple.,"Then, he drove the devil to the holy city of Jerusalem, and he put him on a high place above the house of God,"
وݣال ليه: «إلا كنت ولد الله، رمي راسك للتحت، علاحقاش مكتوب فكتاب الله: الله غادي يوصي الملايكة دياله عليك، وعلى يديهم غيهزوك باش رجلك ما تضربش مع الحجر».,"""If you are the Son of God,"" he said, ""throw yourself down.

«آ بلاد زبولون وبلاد نفتالي،  اللي فطريق البحر من الجهة لخرى ديال واد الأردن،  بلاد الجليل ديال الشعوب اللي ماشي يهود!,"""Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali!  Galilee, where non-Jewish people live!

They are now living in a very dark land.  But a light will shine on them.""

A Roman Commander Has Faith","And Jesus said to him, 'Be careful not to tell anyone, but go and give the religious man the gift that Moses commanded, so that it may be a testimony to them."

وملي سمعه يسوع تعجب وݣال لهادوك اللي تابعينه: «نݣول ليكم الحق: ما لقيت حتى شي واحد فإسرائيل عنده إيمان قوي بحال هادا.,"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those following him, ""What I'm about to tell you is true. In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong.","When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to his followers, ""I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel who has such faith."

ومن بعد، ݣال يسوع للقايد د العسكر: «سير! على قد الإيمان ديالك، غادي يكون ليك داكشي اللي بغيتي». وفديك الساعة نيت تشافى الخدام دياله. يسوع كيشافي نسيبة بطرس وبزاف د الناس,"Then Jesus said to the Roman commander, ""Go! It will be done just as you believed it would.""  And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus Heals Many People","Then, Jesus said to the captain of the regiment, go! according to your faith, you will be given what you want "

وهكا تحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا: «هو اللي خدا وجعنا وهز مرضنا». كيفاش خاص يكونو هادوك اللي كيتبعو يسوع,"He did it to make what the prophet Isaiah had said come true.

But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.""","Jesus answered, ""Foxes have many nests, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."

وجات واحد الريح قوية بزاف فالبحر حتى عمرو الماج الفلوكة، وكان يسوع ناعس.,Suddenly a terrible storm came up on the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.,"A very strong wind hit the sea, and the water broke."

Two men controlled by demons met him. They came from the tombs. The men were so wild that no one could pass that way.,"When Jesus came across the sea to the country of the Germans, he was met by two mad men outside the prison, and they were too dangerous, so no one could pass through the way."

Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he got to the temple, and ate the bread they offered to God, which he or his companions should not eat except religious people."

Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path.,"When you hear the word of God and don't understand it, the devil comes and takes what you planted in your heart, and it's like the seed that fell in the road."
واللي تزرع فالأرض المحجرة، هادا هو اللي كيسمع كلام الله وكيقبله دغيا بالفرحة،,Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.,"And he who is sown in the rock, he is he who hears the word of God and accepts it with joy,"

They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.,"But the word of God is not good in his heart, and his faith is short-lived, and when problems and outrace arise, he is quickly removed from the faith."
واللي مزروع وسط الشوك، هو اللي كيسمع كلام الله ولكن هم الدنيا ومحبة الفلوس كيخنقو كلام الله فيه وما كيعطي غلة.,Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are those who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep it from producing fruit.,"Those who are planted in the middle of the twins, are those who listen to the word of God but are worldly and money-loving."

وجاوبه بطرس: «من البراني». وهو يݣول يسوع: «على هادشي ولادهم راهم معفيين من الضريبة.,"""From others,"" Peter answered.  ""Then the sons don't have to pay,"" Jesus said to him.","Peter answered, ""from the outside""."
ولكن باش ما نتسببوش ليهم فشي مشكل، سير للبحر ورمي الصنارة، والحوتة اللولى اللي غتشدها، حل ليها فمها، وغادي تلقا فيه ربعة ديال الدراهم، خدها وسير خلص عليك وعلي».,"""But we don't want to make them angry. So go to the lake and throw out your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the exact coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.""","But to avoid causing them a problem, go to the beach and throw the shrimp, and the first fish you catch, put it in its mouth, and you'll find a quarter of a dirham, take it and go pay for it and so on."
