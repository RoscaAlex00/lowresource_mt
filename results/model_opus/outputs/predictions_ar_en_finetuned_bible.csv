وبقى تم حتى مات هيرودس باش يتحقق كلام الرب على لسان النبي اللي ݣال: «من مصر عيطت على ولدي». هيرودس كيقتل الدراري الصغار,"They stayed there until King Herod died. So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true. He had said, ""I chose to bring my son out of Egypt.""

وملي شاف هيرودس بلي العلما د النجوم لعبو بيه، تقلق بزاف وآمر باش يتقتلو ݣاع الدراري اللي فبيت لحم والنواحي ديالها من ولد عامين للتحت، حيت هادي هي المدة اللي دازت على الوقت اللي عرفه من العلما د النجوم،,Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him.

This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star.,"i will go to the stars to play with him, too worried to kill him"
وهكا تحقق كلام الرب على لسان النبي إرميا اللي ݣال:,"In this way, the words the prophet Jeremiah spoke came true. He had said,",That is how the word of the Lord came true to the words of the prophet:

He will gather his wheat into the storeroom. But he will burn up the husks with fire that can't be put out.""

It carries out God's holy plan."" Then John agreed.","Jesus answered him and asked him: if he is not allowed to speak well, it is our duty to do what he wants to do."

He also lives on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "" (Deuteronomy 8:3)","Jesus answered: in the book of God, there is nothing but bread alone to live with regret, but to live with every word so that God will give it to him."

He is the only one you should serve.' "" (Deuteronomy 6:13)","He will reply to him: go ahead with you, Satan!

وملي سمع يسوع بلي يوحنا المعمدان تشد فالحبس، رجع بحاله للجليل. متى,"John had been put in prison. When Jesus heard about this, he returned to Galilee.","I will tell him that he heard of John's baptism in prison, that he will go back to his place in the morning."
وخلا الناصرة ومشى سكن فكفرناحوم اللي حدا بحر الجليل فبلاد زبولون ونفتالي. يوحنا,Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the city of Capernaum. It was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali.,"and he went to his place of residence in the desert of the sea of Galilee, in the country of Zebulun and Naphthali."
وهكا تحقق داكشي اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"In that way, what the prophet Isaiah had said came true. He had said,",this is how you check the prophet

(Isaiah 9:1,2)","the people who dont think they will have a great light, and they will live in the country of death and in the middle of it, they will have one light on them."

""Turn away from your sins!"" he said. ""The kingdom of heaven is near."" Jesus Chooses the First Disciples",It is time that Jesus began to tell people what to do!

الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,the class is like Jesus to know on the Saturday
وفديك ليام، فواحد السبت، داز يسوع بين الفدادن د الزرع، وكان فتلامده الجوع، وهم يبداو كيقطعو السبول وكياكلو.,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"your delegation is today, on a Saturday, Jesus went into the farm, and he was hungry, and they started to slice and eat."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!""",i will show them what they want to do on Saturdays!
ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.","he said, why do you want to go hungry with him and him?"
وكيفاش دخل لبيت الله، وكلا الخبز اللي كيقدموه لله، اللي ما كانش خاص ياكله لا هو ولا هادوك اللي معاه من غير رجال الدين بوحدهم.,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And he went to the house of God, and he didn't eat the bread he gave him, and he didn't eat it alone."
واش ما قريتوش فالتوراة بلي رجال الدين وهم كيخدمو فبيت الله نهار السبت، كيتعداو على السبت، وواخا داكشي ما عليهم لوم؟,Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"Why don't you tell the men of religion that they do work in the house on Saturdays, that they go on Saturdays and what are they to blame?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.","But I'm going to tell you, this is where he grew up from the house of God."
وكون فهمتو المعنى ديال الآية اللي كتݣول: بغيت الرحمة ماشي الدبيحة، كون ݣاع ما حكمتو على اللي ما عليهم لوم.,"Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.","And if you understand the meaning of what I said, why do you want mercy to be good, if you don't judge why they shouldn't blame me?"
حيت ولد الإنسان هو الرب ديال السبت». يسوع كيشافي فنهار السبت,"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.""","when the child of man is born, he is the father of the day of the day."
ومشى من تم وجا لدار الصلاة ديالهم،,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.",who went to the prayer house
ولقا واحد الراجل يده مشلولة. وهم يسولوه وݣالو: «واش حلال الشفا نهار السبت؟» سولوه باش يلقاو عليه شي تهمة.,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""","He found one man crippled, and they asked him and he asked for help on Saturday mornings?"
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?","And they answered: if only one of you had a lamb and he went to him on Saturday morning, why is he joking and shagging him and bringing him out?"
إيوا راه قيمة بنادم كتر بزاف من الخروف! وهادشي علاش عمل الخير حلال نهار السبت».,"A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.""",i think it's worth a lot of sheep!
وݣال يسوع للراجل اللي يده مشلولة: «مد يدك!» ومدها، وهي تولي صحيحة بحال اليد لخرى.,"Then Jesus said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.",the man is paralyzed in his hand: extend your hand!
وخرجو الفريسيين كيتافقو كيفاش يقتلوه. يسوع هو المختار من الله,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant,and they went out to come up and kill him; Jesus is chosen from God
وملي ساق يسوع الخبار، مشى من تم وتبعوه جماعات كتار من الناس، وشفاهم كلهم.,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.","He told him the news, and he went to many groups of people who followed him, and he showed them all."
ووصاهم باش ما يخبرو حد عليه.,But he warned them not to tell who he was.,they will tell no one about him.
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,",The words of the prophet are not fulfilled:
«ها هو عبدي اللي ختاريت،  العزيز ديالي اللي بيه نفسي فرحات بزاف.  غادي نحط عليه روحي،  وغيخبر الشعوب بالحق.,"""Here is my servant. I have chosen him.  He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.","my servant is the one I have chosen, my dear friend who is very happy"
ما غيتخاصم وما غيغوت،  حتى حد ما غيسمع صوته فالزناقي.,He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.,"I didn't talk, I didn't talk, I didn't even hear his voice in the niggers."
قصبة مشقوقة ما غيهرس،  وفتيلة كتطلق الدخان ما غيطفي،  حتى يرد الحق هو اللي غالب.,He will not break a bent twig.  He will not put out a dimly burning flame.  He will make everything right.,"the story is that he is not sober, and he is afraid to smoke what he is, until the truth is what he is most likely to do."
وفالإسم دياله غيديرو الشعوب رجاهم». يسوع وبعلزبول,"The nations will put their hope in him."" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub","in the name of his mother, he gave the people his hope."
وجابو شي ناس ليسوع واحد الراجل عمى وزيزون وساكنه جن، وهو يشافيه، وهكا ولى قادر يتكلم ويشوف.,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.,"He brought people to this man who are blind and masturbated, and he is healing him, and he is able to speak and see."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس وݣالو: «ياكما هادا هو بن داود؟».,"All the people were amazed. They said, ""Could this be the Son of David?""","The crowds liked the people and they said, ""Here is the son of David?"
وملي سمعو الفريسيين هادشي ݣالو: «هادا راه ما كيخرج الجنون غير ببعلزبول رئيس الجنون». متى 9‏:34؛ 10‏:25,"The Pharisees heard this. So they said, ""This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.""",And they heard of the cheerful cheese: there is no madness to go out without the head of the madness.
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «كل مملكة كتقسم كتخرب، وكل مدينة ولا عائلة كتقسم ما غتدومش.,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","Jesus knew what he thought and what to do: every kingdom was divided as a spoiler, every city and no family was divided as it fell apart."
إيوا إلا كان الشيطان كيخرج الشيطان، غادي يكون الشيطان تقسم وولى ضد راسه، وإلا تقسم وولى ضد راسه كيفاش غادي تبقى مملكته تابتة؟,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?","if only the devil were to bring out the devil, he will be sworn against his head or he will be sworn against his head how will he keep his kingdom?"
وإلا كنت أنا ببعلزبول كنخرج الجنون، إيوا شكون هادا اللي ولادكم كيخرجوهم بيه؟ على هادشي راه ولادكم اللي غادي يحكمو عليكم.,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.","If only I was going to go out insane, why do you want to bring them out?"
ولكن إلا كنت أنا بروح الله كنخرج الجنون، راه مملكة الله جات فوسط منكم.,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.,"But only I, in the spirit of Allah, will go out insanity, see the kingdom of Allah come in the middle of you."
وكيفاش يقدر شي حد يدخل لدار شي واحد صحيح ويسرق ليه حوايجه بلا ما يكتفه فاللول، وعاد يسرق ليه داره؟,"""Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.",And how can anyone enter the house of a true one and steal his clothes without his own money and steal his house again?
اللي ماشي معاي راه ضدي، واللي ما كيجمعش معاي راه كيفرق. مرقس 9‏:40,"""Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.","i dont want to see him against me, i dont want to bring him along"
داكشي علاش نݣول ليكم: كل دنب وكل كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال غيتغفر للناس، ولكن كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال على الروح القدس ما غيتغفرش.,So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.,"I dont want to ask you: every penis and all the talk of infidels that you will forgive people, but the talk of ingratitude that you will not forgive in the Holy Spirit."
اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد ولد الإنسان غيتغفر ليه، ولكن اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد الروح القدس ما غاديش يتغفر ليه لا فهاد الدنيا ولا فلاخرة». لوقا 12‏:10 الشجرة وغلتها,Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.,"who is a word against the son of man he forgives him, but who is a word against the Holy Spirit he will not forgive him"
«غرسو شجرة مزيانة وغتكون غلتها مزيانة، ولا غرسو شجرة خايبة وغتكون غلتها خايبة. راه من الغلة كتعرف الشجرة. متى,"""If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good.

آ تريكة اللفاعي! كيفاش تقدرو تݣولو شي كلام مزيان ونتم ما مزيانينش؟ راه داكشي اللي كيخرج من القلب كيتكلم بيه الفم. متى,"""You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.",how do you like to talk nicely and do what do you do?
بنادم المزيان كيخرج الحوايج المزيانين من الكنز المزيان اللي فقلبه، وبنادم الخايب كيخرج الحوايج الخايبين من الكنز الخايب اللي فقلبه.,A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.,I regret the good stuff to get the good stuff out of the good treasure and the bad stuff to get the bad stuff out of the bad treasure.
ونݣول ليكم: راه كل هضرة خاوية كيݣولوها الناس، غادي يتحاسبو عليها فيوم الحساب.,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.",i will tell you: every evening is empty so that people will pay for it on the day of reckoning.
علاحقاش راه بكلامك غادي يتحكم عليك يا إما باري ويا إما مدنب». العلما د الشرع والفريسيين بغاو يشوفو شي علامة,"By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty."" The Miraculous Sign of Jonah","i will not speak to you, either my father or I will tell you what is a sign"
وديك الساعة ردو عليه شي وحدين من العلما د الشرع والفريسيين وݣالو: «آ سيدي، راه بغينا نشوفو منك شي علامة». متى,"Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, ""Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.""",And you have the time to tell him a few things about the science of the law and the masculinity and how is it that you will find a sign from him?
وهو يݣول ليهم: «جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة! وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة النبي يونان. متى,"He answered, ""Evil and unfaithful people ask for a miraculous sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.","And he will tell them: when will he ask for a sign, he will never give him a sign other than the sign of the Prophet?"
علاحقاش كما بقى يونان فكرش الحوتة تلت يام وتلت ليالي، هكا غادي يبقى ولد الإنسان فقلب الأرض تلت يام وتلت ليالي.,Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.,"I will never forget the whale after the nights, it will be the son of man and the heart of the earth will come and follow my nights."

راه ملي كيخرج الجن من بنادم كيمشي يضور فبلايص ما فيهمش الما، كيقلب على الراحة وما كيلقاهاش،,"""What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find it.",i want to get the jinns out of the bedroom

ونعت بيده لجهة تلامده وݣال: «ها هم مي وخوتي،,"Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, ""Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!",he called his hand to his corsage

الفصل تلطاش المتال ديال الزارع,The Story of the Farmer,The season is too late for the farm
وفداك النهار نيت، خرج يسوع من الدار وݣلس فجنب البحر.,That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.,"the day I came, Jesus went out of the house and went to the sea"
وتجمعو عليه بزاف د الجماعات د الناس، وبقوة الزحام طلع للفلوكة وݣلس فيها، ووقفو الجماعات د الناس كلهم على جنب البحر. لوقا 5‏:1‏-3,Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat down in it. All the people stood on the shore.,"They gathered together with the crowds, and with the strength of the crowd, they made a lot of money in it, and they stopped all the people on the side of the sea."
وعاود ليهم بزاف د الحوايج بالمتول وݣال: «هادا واحد الراجل خرج باش يزرع،,"Then he told them many things by using stories.  He said, ""A farmer went out to plant his seed.",he went back to him in the woods in the mall
وملي كان كيزرع، طاحو شي حبات فالطريق وجاو الطيور وكلاوهم.,He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up.,and he was going to plant a few pills in the way and there are birds and eat them.
وطاحو حبات خرين فواحد الأرض محجرة ما فيهاش تراب كتير، ودغيا نبتو حيت التراب ما كانش غارق،,"Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasn't deep.","they cooked other pills in the ground and there are no dust too much, and they started to eat the dirt when it wasn't too dark,"

It has not been given to outsiders.","he will answer to them: they will not understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they will not understand them."

Those people are like the seed planted on a path.,"who listens to talk about the kingdom of God and how do they care about the devil and if he kidnaps him who sows his heart, that is what we like to plant in the road."
واللي تزرع فالأرض المحجرة، هادا هو اللي كيسمع كلام الله وكيقبله دغيا بالفرحة،,Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.,that is the one to listen to the words of God and to kiss him with joy

They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.,"But God's Word is not good for his heart, his faith is only a little longer, and he tells me that he will make troubles and feuds, so that he will not listen to faith."

So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do stealing, false witness, and telling lies about others.","I dont want to get the wrong ideas: in the case of the deceased, the corruption of the married couple and the money of the married couple, the theft, the testimony of the defamatory, and the Spanish."

وهي تجي عنده واحد المراة كنعانية من هادوك الجوايه، وغوتات وݣالت: «رحمني آ سيدي آ بن داود! راه بنتي ساكنها جن كيعدبها بزاف».,"A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, ""Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon controls my daughter. She is suffering terribly.""","She comes to him with a woman who has a cup of tea, a horse and a lot of money!"
ولكن ما جاوبها حتى بكلمة. وقربو ليه تلامده وطلبوه وݣالو: «صيفطها بحالها، علاحقاش تابعانا وكتغوت!».,"Jesus did not say a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him, ""Send her away.

ولكن جات ديك المراة وسجدات ليه وݣالت: «عاوني آ سيدي!»,"Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. ""Lord! Help me!"" she said.",But this woman came along and came to him and asked for help!
وجاوبها وݣال: «ماشي معقول يتخاد خبز الولاد ويترمى للكلاب»,"He replied, ""It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs.""",he answered it and he said:

You will be given what you are asking for."" And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand","Jesus and he said: you have great faith in this woman, you will have what you want to do, and you will have the hour to heal her daughter."
ومن بعد، مشى يسوع من تم لجنب البحر ديال الجليل، وطلع للجبل وݣلس تم.,Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.,"And then, Jesus walked from the side of the mountain and went to the mountain"
وجاو لعنده جماعات كتار د الناس ومعاهم عرجين وعميين وزحافا وزيازن وناس خرين كتار، وحطوهم عند رجليه وشفاهم.,"Large crowds came to him. They brought blind people and those who could not walk. They also brought disabled people, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.","He came to have many groups of people with them who were blind and blind, and they were beautiful and other people who were old, and he gave them to his feet and their lips."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس حيت شافو الزيازن كيتكلمو، والعرجين كيتشافاو، والزحافا كيمشيو، والعميين كيشوفو، وعطاو العز لإلاه إسرائيل. يسوع كيوكل ربعالاف واحد,The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were made well. Those not able to walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.,"And the crowds liked the people when they started talking, and the limps are talking, and they are talking to them, and they are blind to them, and they are giving their money to the god of Israel."
وعيط يسوع على تلامده وݣال ليهم: «بقاو في هاد الناس، علاحقاش تلت يام هادي وهم معاي، وما عندهم ما ياكلو. وما بغيتش نصيفطهم جيعانين باش ما يسخفوش فالطريق».,"Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, ""I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home.""","And he gave him a lot of money: they stayed in these people, and they went after them, and they didn't have anything to eat."

""Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?""",And they asked me to tell him: who is going to answer this bread that fills a large group in good condition?
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «شحال من خبزة عندكم؟»، وجاوبوه: «سبعة د الخبزات وشي حوتات صغار».,"""How many loaves do you have?"" Jesus asked.  ""Seven,"" they replied, ""and a few small fish.""",Jesus told me: how much bread do you have?

وخدا هادوك سبعة د الخبزات والحوتات، وشكر الله وقطعهم وعطى لتلامده، وتلامده عطاو للجماعات د الناس.,He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people.,"they took seven of the breads and the whales, thank God and cut them and gave them to his students, and they gave them to the people."
وكلاو كلهم حتى شبعو، وهزو سبعة د الݣفات عامرين بالطروف د الخبز اللي شاطو.,"All of them ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces.","They all went to bed, and they rocked the seven of them with the bread to eat."
وكانو الناس اللي كلاو ربعالاف واحد من غير العيالات والولاد.,"The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.",And they were the people who were quarter a thousand other than children.
وملي صيفط يسوع الجماعات د الناس، ركب فالفلوكة وجا لجوايه بلاد مجدان.,"After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan.","It is not easy for the people to join the group, but it is a good place for the people to come to the country in a new country."
الفصل سطاش علامات الزمان,Jesus Is Asked for a Miraculous Sign,the season is the mark of time
وجاو لعند يسوع شي وحدين من الفريسيين والصدوقيين باش يجربوه، وطلبو منه يبين ليهم شي علامة من السما. متى,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.,"and came to Jesus with something alone from the fries and friends to try it, and asked him to show them a sign of the poison."
ولكن هو جاوبهم وݣال: «ملي كتغرب الشمس كتݣولو: الجو غيكون صافي، علاحقاش السما حمرا.,"He replied, ""In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be good weather. The sky is red.'",But he answered them:
وفالصباح بكري كتݣولو: اليوم غادي تكون الشتا، علاحقاش السما حمرا ومضببة. كتعرفو تفسرو حالة الجو، ولكن علامات الزمان ما كتقدروش تفسروهم!,"And in the morning you say, 'Today it will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now.","And in the early morning you will read: the day will be long, the poison will be red and pulse; you will explain the weather, but the signs of time will not explain them!"
جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة، وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة يونان». ومن بعد خلاهم يسوع ومشى. متى 12‏:39؛ لوقا 11‏:29 خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين,"An evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.""  Then Jesus left them and went away. The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees","An ugly and corrupt generation will ask for a mark, and they will not give it a sign without the sign of the sun."
وملي وصلو التلامد للجهة لخرى من البحر، نساو ياخدو معاهم الخبز.,The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread.,they came to the side of the sea to take bread with them.
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «ردو البال، حضيو راسكم من خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين!». لوقا,"""Be careful,"" Jesus said to them. ""Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.""","I will ask Jesus: take care of yourself, bring your head from the wines of the Pharisees and the Sadducians!"
وهم يݣولو مع راسهم: «كيݣول لينا هاد الكلام علاحقاش ما خديناش معانا الخبز».,"The disciples talked about this among themselves. They said, ""He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread.""",And they want to go to their head: let's talk about the bread we don't have.
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «علاش آ قلالين الإيمان كتݣولو فخاطركم: ما عندنا خبز؟,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, ""Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?",And Jesus knew how they thought and what they thought: we have no bread?
واش مازال ما فهمتو؟ واش ما عقلتوش على خمسة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على خمسالاف واحد، وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو من الطروف د الخبز؟ متى,"Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?",what do you still understand?
وما عقلتوش على سبعة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على ربعالاف واحد وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو؟ متى,"Don't you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?",when do you remember how many breads you have?

But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.""",how can you not understand that I didn't mean to talk to you about bread?
وديك الساعة، عاد فهمو تلامده بلي ݣال ليهم يحضيو راسهم من تعليم الفريسيين والصدوقيين، ماشي من خميرة الخبز. بطرس كيشهد بلي يسوع هو المسيح,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ,"And you have the hour, and he came back to me to give them their head from the teaching of the preys and the friends, what is the wine of bread?"
وملي وصل يسوع لجوايه قيصرية فيلبس، سول تلامده: «شكون هو ولد الإنسان فنضر الناس؟»,"Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say the Son of Man is?""",why did he arrive in the caesar at phibs?

Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.""","They will answer: I will ask him to say: John the Baptist, and she will ask: the prophet Elijah, and only two others will ask him to say: the prophet is tossed away from the prophet when he is not one of the prophets."
وسولهم: «ونتم شكون أنا فنضركم؟».,"""But what about you?"" he asked. ""Who do you say I am?""",why do you think that I'm waiting for you?
وجاوب سمعان بطرس وݣال: «نت هو المسيح ولد الله الحي!»، يوحنا,"Simon Peter answered, ""You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God.""",he answered: I am the son of the living God!

وأنا راني نݣول ليك: نت بطرس، وعلى هاد الصخرة غادي نبني كنيستي، وقوة الموت ما غتقدرش عليها.,Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.,I want to tell you that I will build my church and the power of death will never be able to do so.

ومن بعد وصى يسوع تلامده باش ما يݣولو لحتى شي حد بلي هو المسيح. يسوع كيتنبأ بالموت والبعت دياله,Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus Tells About His Coming Death,"And after he commanded him, he will not wait until he is the Messiah, that he may predict death and sell his money"
ومن ديك الساعة، بدا يسوع كيبين لتلامده بلي خاصه يمشي لأورشليم ويتعدب بزاف على يد الشيوخ والرؤسا د رجال الدين والعلما د الشرع، وخاصه يتقتل، وفاليوم التالت غيتبعت من الموت.,"From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again.","From this hour, Jesus seemed to teach him that he will go to Jerusalem and that he will suffer too much at the hands of the elders and the men of religion and science and the law, and in particular he will be killed, and the next day he will be followed from death."
وجره بطرس للجنب وبدا كيخاصم عليه وكيݣول: «حاشا آ سيدي باش يطرا ليك هادشي!»،,"Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. ""Never, Lord!"" he said. ""This will never happen to you!""",And he took Peter to the side and he started to argue with him and he said:

You do not have in mind the things of God. Instead, you are thinking about human things.""",he is spoiled and he is hurting me: after me is the devil!
وهو يݣول يسوع لتلامده: «إلا بغا شي واحد يتبعني، خاصه يسمح فراسه ويهز الصليب دياله ويتبعني، متى,"Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, ""If anyone wants to follow me, he must say no to himself. He must pick up his cross and follow me.","And he is going to teach him: he will only follow me, especially his head will shake the cross and follow me when"
علاحقاش اللي بغا ينجي حياته غيضيعها، ولكن اللي ضيع حياته على قبلي غيلقاها. متى,"If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.","i will never let his life go to waste, but he will not let his life go to hers."

ومن بعد ست يام، دا يسوع بطرس ويعقوب وخوه يوحنا، وطلعهم بوحدهم لواحد الجبل عالي.,"After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain.

His clothes became as white as the light.,"The shape changed before them, and they painted his face like the sun, his wall and no eggs like light."
