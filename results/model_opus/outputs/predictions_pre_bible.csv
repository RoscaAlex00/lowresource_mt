وتجمعو عليه بزاف د الجماعات د الناس، وبقوة الزحام طلع للفلوكة وݣلس فيها، ووقفو الجماعات د الناس كلهم على جنب البحر. لوقا 5‏:1‏-3,Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat down in it. All the people stood on the shore.,"They gathered on it with the Zav of the communities, the people, the crowd, the flute, the people all stood on the side of the sea. Luke 5:1 - 3."
وعاود ليهم بزاف د الحوايج بالمتول وݣال: «هادا واحد الراجل خرج باش يزرع،,"Then he told them many things by using stories.  He said, ""A farmer went out to plant his seed.","And he came back to me with the Zav D'Hawaj in the mall, and he said: ""The man came out of Bash to grow,"
وملي كان كيزرع، طاحو شي حبات فالطريق وجاو الطيور وكلاوهم.,He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up.,"And Mellie was a kaiser, and they grinded Chee-Pills on the road and the birds and their chalk."

The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now.","In the morning, Bakri Kattulu: Today, the Gadi is the Sita, Aramash, the poison is red and pulse. You know, explain the state of the air, but the signs of time aren't capable of explaining them!"
جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة، وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة يونان». ومن بعد خلاهم يسوع ومشى. متى 12‏:39؛ لوقا 11‏:29 خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين,"An evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.""  Then Jesus left them and went away. The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees","An ugly and corrupt generation to ask for a sign, and what Gady gives to Shia is a sign without the sign of Jonah.

وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «علاش آ قلالين الإيمان كتݣولو فخاطركم: ما عندنا خبز؟,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, ""Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?","And Jesus knew Fash Kifkro and Mal Lehem: ""Ah, we have no faith, and if not, how do you think: we have no bread?"""
واش مازال ما فهمتو؟ واش ما عقلتوش على خمسة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على خمسالاف واحد، وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو من الطروف د الخبز؟ متى,"Don't you understand yet?

وديك الساعة، عاد فهمو تلامده بلي ݣال ليهم يحضيو راسهم من تعليم الفريسيين والصدوقيين، ماشي من خميرة الخبز. بطرس كيشهد بلي يسوع هو المسيح,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ,"And you have the watch, and they come back, and they give it to me, and they give their head from the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, walking from the bread wine. Peter, to bear witness to Jesus, Jesus Christ."

What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.""","And the kingdom of the heavens, all that is needed, the earth is bound, and the heavens are bound, and every need is covered; the earth is dissolved, and the heavens are numbered."
ومن بعد وصى يسوع تلامده باش ما يݣولو لحتى شي حد بلي هو المسيح. يسوع كيتنبأ بالموت والبعت دياله,Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus Tells About His Coming Death,"And after Jesus commanded him, Bash didn't put him to rest, that he might even be the end of the thing; but he was the Christ. Jesus, that he might predict death, and sold his religion."
ومن ديك الساعة، بدا يسوع كيبين لتلامده بلي خاصه يمشي لأورشليم ويتعدب بزاف على يد الشيوخ والرؤسا د رجال الدين والعلما د الشرع، وخاصه يتقتل، وفاليوم التالت غيتبعت من الموت.,"From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him.
