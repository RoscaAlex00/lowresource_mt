This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star.,"And he told me that the stars played with him, that he is too worried to kill the kids in the kitchen and the parts of a two-year-old boy downstairs, and that's how long he has gone to the time he knew of the stars,"

Those who were trying to kill the child are dead.""","And what is going on is that he took the boy and went back to the country of Israel, and that was when he killed the boy who died."

الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,the class is too many for him to know on Saturday
وفديك ليام، فواحد السبت، داز يسوع بين الفدادن د الزرع، وكان فتلامده الجوع، وهم يبداو كيقطعو السبول وكياكلو.,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"Your parents are working, on Saturday, when Jesus went between the gardens, he was hungry, and he started to cut the piss and eat."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!""",They told the french to see if you could find any clothes they need to do on Saturday!
ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.","And he said, do you think that he and he are hungry?"
وكيفاش دخل لبيت الله، وكلا الخبز اللي كيقدموه لله، اللي ما كانش خاص ياكله لا هو ولا هادوك اللي معاه من غير رجال الدين بوحدهم.,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he went to the house of god, and all the bread they give to God, which he didn't have to eat either he or he is with them without the religious men alone."
واش ما قريتوش فالتوراة بلي رجال الدين وهم كيخدمو فبيت الله نهار السبت، كيتعداو على السبت، وواخا داكشي ما عليهم لوم؟,Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"do you not read the Bible about the religious men who work in the house on Saturdays, so they can go on Saturdays, and they have nothing to blame them for?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.",But I'm telling you: this is where he grew up from God's house.
وكون فهمتو المعنى ديال الآية اللي كتݣول: بغيت الرحمة ماشي الدبيحة، كون ݣاع ما حكمتو على اللي ما عليهم لوم.,"Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.","And if you understand the meaning of the text that you wrote: I want mercy for nothing, if only I didn't judge who they shouldn't blame."
حيت ولد الإنسان هو الرب ديال السبت». يسوع كيشافي فنهار السبت,"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.""",I gave birth to the son of a man who is the god of the Saturday.
ومشى من تم وجا لدار الصلاة ديالهم،,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.","who went to their prayer house,"
ولقا واحد الراجل يده مشلولة. وهم يسولوه وݣالو: «واش حلال الشفا نهار السبت؟» سولوه باش يلقاو عليه شي تهمة.,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""",The man has a paralyzed hand. They ask him and ask him: What are the lips on Saturday?
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?","They answered: if only one of you had a sheep and a hole in him on Saturday day, didn't he hurry up and shake it and bring it out?"
إيوا راه قيمة بنادم كتر بزاف من الخروف! وهادشي علاش عمل الخير حلال نهار السبت».,"A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.""",It's worth more than a lot of sheep! That's why you do good work on Saturdays.
وݣال يسوع للراجل اللي يده مشلولة: «مد يدك!» ومدها، وهي تولي صحيحة بحال اليد لخرى.,"Then Jesus said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.",Jesus asked the man who is paralyzed: extend your hand!
وخرجو الفريسيين كيتافقو كيفاش يقتلوه. يسوع هو المختار من الله,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant,and the prey came out so that they could kill him; Jesus is the chosen one from God.
وملي ساق يسوع الخبار، مشى من تم وتبعوه جماعات كتار من الناس، وشفاهم كلهم.,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.","And Jesus told the news, he went from being followed by a lot of people, and he healed them all."
ووصاهم باش ما يخبرو حد عليه.,But he warned them not to tell who he was.,He told them what to tell him.
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,",The words of the prophet are true:
«ها هو عبدي اللي ختاريت،  العزيز ديالي اللي بيه نفسي فرحات بزاف.  غادي نحط عليه روحي،  وغيخبر الشعوب بالحق.,"""Here is my servant. I have chosen him.  He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.","He is my servant who has chosen, my dear friend who has many joys. I will bring him my soul, and he will tell the people the truth."
ما غيتخاصم وما غيغوت،  حتى حد ما غيسمع صوته فالزناقي.,He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.,"I didn't argue and I didn't argue, so he didn't even hear his voice in the alleys."
قصبة مشقوقة ما غيهرس،  وفتيلة كتطلق الدخان ما غيطفي،  حتى يرد الحق هو اللي غالب.,He will not break a bent twig.  He will not put out a dimly burning flame.  He will make everything right.,"a rough story isn't clear, and a girl who smokes smoke isn't welcome, until the truth is he is most likely."
وفالإسم دياله غيديرو الشعوب رجاهم». يسوع وبعلزبول,"The nations will put their hope in him."" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub",And in the name of his people he made people happy.
وجابو شي ناس ليسوع واحد الراجل عمى وزيزون وساكنه جن، وهو يشافيه، وهكا ولى قادر يتكلم ويشوف.,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.,"And he brought people to someone who is blind and crazy, who heals him, who is able to speak and see."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس وݣالو: «ياكما هادا هو بن داود؟».,"All the people were amazed. They said, ""Could this be the Son of David?""",The crowds are impressed by the fact that he is the son of David.
وملي سمعو الفريسيين هادشي ݣالو: «هادا راه ما كيخرج الجنون غير ببعلزبول رئيس الجنون». متى 9‏:34؛ 10‏:25,"The Pharisees heard this. So they said, ""This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.""",they heard the frenzis say that they didn't go crazy except for the head of the madness
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «كل مملكة كتقسم كتخرب، وكل مدينة ولا عائلة كتقسم ما غتدومش.,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","Jesus knew how much he thought about them: every kingdom is divided as a spoiler, and every city or family is divided not always."
إيوا إلا كان الشيطان كيخرج الشيطان، غادي يكون الشيطان تقسم وولى ضد راسه، وإلا تقسم وولى ضد راسه كيفاش غادي تبقى مملكته تابتة؟,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?","if only the devil was going to bring out the devil, he will be sworn against his head, or he will swear against his head how will his kingdom remain silent?"
وإلا كنت أنا ببعلزبول كنخرج الجنون، إيوا شكون هادا اللي ولادكم كيخرجوهم بيه؟ على هادشي راه ولادكم اللي غادي يحكمو عليكم.,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.","Otherwise I'm going to go crazy, do you think that's what you have to bring to him?"
ولكن إلا كنت أنا بروح الله كنخرج الجنون، راه مملكة الله جات فوسط منكم.,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.,"But if only I was in God's spirit to go mad, the kingdom of god came in the middle of you."
وكيفاش يقدر شي حد يدخل لدار شي واحد صحيح ويسرق ليه حوايجه بلا ما يكتفه فاللول، وعاد يسرق ليه داره؟,"""Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.","how can someone enter the house and steal his clothes without being alone in the first place, and then steal his house?"
اللي ماشي معاي راه ضدي، واللي ما كيجمعش معاي راه كيفرق. مرقس 9‏:40,"""Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.","who is not with me is against me, and who will not join me"
داكشي علاش نݣول ليكم: كل دنب وكل كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال غيتغفر للناس، ولكن كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال على الروح القدس ما غيتغفرش.,So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.,"There is nothing to say to you: all of the disgusting talk that you have done is forgiven people, but the infidel talk that you have done is not forgiven the holy spirit."
اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد ولد الإنسان غيتغفر ليه، ولكن اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد الروح القدس ما غاديش يتغفر ليه لا فهاد الدنيا ولا فلاخرة». لوقا 12‏:10 الشجرة وغلتها,Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.,"who is a word against the son of man you will forgive him, but who is a word against the holy spirit will not forgive him not in this world or in the countryside."
«غرسو شجرة مزيانة وغتكون غلتها مزيانة، ولا غرسو شجرة خايبة وغتكون غلتها خايبة. راه من الغلة كتعرف الشجرة. متى,"""If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.","They plant a good tree and its fruit is good, or it's bad and it's bad. It's too good to know the tree when."
آ تريكة اللفاعي! كيفاش تقدرو تݣولو شي كلام مزيان ونتم ما مزيانينش؟ راه داكشي اللي كيخرج من القلب كيتكلم بيه الفم. متى,"""You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.",how can you do a lot of good talking and you're not good at it?
بنادم المزيان كيخرج الحوايج المزيانين من الكنز المزيان اللي فقلبه، وبنادم الخايب كيخرج الحوايج الخايبين من الكنز الخايب اللي فقلبه.,A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.,"I'm sorry for the good stuff to get the good stuff out of the good treasure, and I'm sorry to get the bad stuff out of the bad money."
ونݣول ليكم: راه كل هضرة خاوية كيݣولوها الناس، غادي يتحاسبو عليها فيوم الحساب.,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.","Let's say: there's all the empty water that people are talking about, they're going to charge for it on the day of the reckoning."
علاحقاش راه بكلامك غادي يتحكم عليك يا إما باري ويا إما مدنب». العلما د الشرع والفريسيين بغاو يشوفو شي علامة,"By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty."" The Miraculous Sign of Jonah","if you say so, he will control you, either Barry or I will thank you."
وديك الساعة ردو عليه شي وحدين من العلما د الشرع والفريسيين وݣالو: «آ سيدي، راه بغينا نشوفو منك شي علامة». متى,"Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, ""Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.""",And you have the hour to tell him the same thing from the science of the law and the frying and the sound of it: when do you want to see a sign from you?
وهو يݣول ليهم: «جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة! وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة النبي يونان. متى,"He answered, ""Evil and unfaithful people ask for a miraculous sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.",He tells them that he is an ugly and corrupt generation to ask for a sign! she will not give him even a mark other than the sign of the prophet Yunnan.
علاحقاش كما بقى يونان فكرش الحوتة تلت يام وتلت ليالي، هكا غادي يبقى ولد الإنسان فقلب الأرض تلت يام وتلت ليالي.,Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.,"It's like when the whale went after the day and went on nights, so the human child will stay at the heart of the earth after the day and the nights later."
ناس نينوى غادي يتبعتو فيوم الحساب مع هاد الجيل ويشهدو عليه، علاحقاش هم تابو ملي نبههم يونان، وها هو دابا هنا واحد فضل من يونان.,"""The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living.

راه ملي كيخرج الجن من بنادم كيمشي يضور فبلايص ما فيهمش الما، كيقلب على الراحة وما كيلقاهاش،,"""What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find it.",it's too late to get the jinns out of the country

وفداك النهار نيت، خرج يسوع من الدار وݣلس فجنب البحر.,That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.,"The day you arrived, Jesus went out of the house and went outside the sea."
وتجمعو عليه بزاف د الجماعات د الناس، وبقوة الزحام طلع للفلوكة وݣلس فيها، ووقفو الجماعات د الناس كلهم على جنب البحر. لوقا 5‏:1‏-3,Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat down in it. All the people stood on the shore.,"It's a lot of people, and it's a lot of crowds, and it's a lot of flavour in it, and it's all the people on the side of the sea."
وعاود ليهم بزاف د الحوايج بالمتول وݣال: «هادا واحد الراجل خرج باش يزرع،,"Then he told them many things by using stories.  He said, ""A farmer went out to plant his seed.",And he gave them a lot of clothes in the mall and a lot of stuff:

وهو يجاوبهم وݣال: «حيت نتم تعطاكم باش تفهمو أسرار مملكة السماوات، ولكن هادوك ما تعطاهمش باش يفهموهم.,"He replied, ""You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders.","He answers them and says, I will give you to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but this you do not give them to understand them."

But they didn't hear it.,"I'll tell you all the truth: he is a good person who wants to see what he is looking for and what he is talking about, and he hears what he hears."
«إيوا سمعو نتم المعنى د المتال ديال الراجل اللي كيزرع:,"""Listen! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer.",listen to me
اللي كيسمع الكلام ديال مملكة الله وما كيفهموش، كيجي الشيطان وكيخطف داكشي اللي تزرع فقلبه، وهادا هو اللي كنشبهه بالزرع اللي طاح فالطريق.,People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path.,"who listen to the words of god's kingdom and how they are not, like the devil and how to kidnap those who plant his heart, this is what I like to plant in the road."
واللي تزرع فالأرض المحجرة، هادا هو اللي كيسمع كلام الله وكيقبله دغيا بالفرحة،,Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.,"you will grow up in the forested land, it is he who listens to God's words and kisses him with joy,"
ولكن كلمة الله ما شاداش مزيان فقلبه، وإيمانه كيبقى غير وقت قليل، وملي كيوقعو المشاكيل والتعدو، كيبعد دغيا على الإيمان.,But they have no roots. So they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.,"But god's word is not good for his heart, and his faith is that he will stay for a little while, and that he will make troubles and aggressions, so that he will go after his faith."
واللي مزروع وسط الشوك، هو اللي كيسمع كلام الله ولكن هم الدنيا ومحبة الفلوس كيخنقو كلام الله فيه وما كيعطي غلة.,Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are those who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep it from producing fruit.,he is the one who listens to God's words but they are the world and the love of money so that they will suffocate God's words in him and give him nothing.

""A man planted good seed in his field.",Jesus gave them another tablet and a lot of money: you look like the kingdom of the heavens to one of the guys who planted a good farm in his country.
وملي كانو الناس ناعسين، جا العدو دياله وزرع ليه الزوان وسط الݣمح ومشى بحاله.,"But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away.","And if people are sleepy, the enemy will come and lay his clothes in the middle of nowhere and go like he is."

وعاود ݣال ليهم متال آخر: «كتشبه مملكة السماوات لواحد الحبة د الخردل خداها واحد الراجل وزرعها فالفدان دياله.,"Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field.",He came to see him again: he liked the Kingdom of Heaven for a mustard pill he took one man and planted it in his country.

""The kingdom of heaven is like yeast,"" he said. ""A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough.""","And he gave them another line and he said, you are like the kingdom of the skies to one woman's cheeks and mix them with a kilo of flour until all of the beams of the paste."
وهادشي كله ݣاله يسوع للجماعات د الناس بالمتول، وبلا متال ما كان كيݣول ليهم حتى حاجة،,Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd by using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.,"And that's all that Jesus is for the people at the hospital, and without all the money he wouldn't give them until he needs it,"

He had said, ""I will open my mouth and tell stories.  I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made."" (Psalm 78:2) Jesus Explains the Story of the Weeds",The words that the prophet made come to be true: he talked and told everything that was hidden from the day when he created the world.

والفدان هو الدنيا، والݣمح المزيان هو ولاد مملكة الله، والزوان هو ولاد الشيطان،,The field is the world. The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.,"It's the world, and it's the best thing that's born of god's kingdom, and the next thing is the birth of the devil,"
والعدو اللي زرع الزوان هو إبليس، والحصاد هو آخر الزمان، والحصادا هم الملايكة.,The enemy who plants them is the devil. The harvest is judgment day. And the workers are angels.,"And the enemy that implants is the devil, and the harvest is the end of time, and the harvest is the milicacs."

He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones."" A Prophet Without Honor",He told them: he is the one who knew the kingdom of the heavens and is like the mother of the house to come out of the treasure for all new and old things.
وملي كمل يسوع هاد المتول، مشى من تم.,Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he moved on from there.,"It's perfect for this motherfucker, he went from there."
ورجع لمدينته الناصرة، كيعلم الناس فديور الصلاة حتى تعجبو وبداو كيسولو: «منين جاته هاد الحكمة وهاد المعجزات؟,"He came to his hometown of Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed.  ""Where did this man get this wisdom?

But Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not honored in his hometown. He doesn't receive any honor in his own home.""","I dont like the situation, but he did not like it, but he didn't like it."

ماشي داكشي اللي كيدخل للفم هو اللي كينجس بنادم، ولكن داكشي اللي كيخرج من الفم هو اللي كينجسه».,"What goes into your mouth does not make you 'unclean.' It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you 'unclean.' ""","It's not like he's getting in the mouth if he's sleeping with him, but he's getting out of the mouth is getting out of his mouth."
ومن بعد جاو عنده التلامد وݣالو ليه: «واش عرفتي بلي الفريسيين تقلقو ملي سمعو كلامك؟».,"Then the disciples came to him. They asked, ""Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?""",And then he came to have the tampons and he asked him: do you know that the prey are worried that you have heard your words?
وجاوبهم وݣال: «ݣاع الغرس اللي ما غرسوش با اللي فالسما غيتݣلع.,"Jesus replied, ""There are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted. They will be pulled up by the roots.",They answered and asked:
خليوهم! هادوك راهم عميين كيݣودو عميين وإلا كان العمى كيݣود العمى، راهم غادي يطيحو بجوج فحفرة». لوقا,"Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another who is blind, both of them will fall into a pit.""","Let them go! they're blind so they're blind or they'll be blind, they'll be hurrying up in a hole."
وݣال ليه بطرس: «بين لينا المعنى ديال هاد المتال!».,"Peter said, ""Explain this to us.""",It's a good idea to tell you what this is about!
وهو يرد عليه: «واش حتى نتم مازال ݣاع ما فهمتو؟,"""Don't you understand yet?"" Jesus asked them.","And he says, what do you think you're still doing?"
واش ما كتعرفوش بلي ݣاع الحاجة اللي كتدخل لفم بنادم كتمشي لكرشه، ومن تم كتخرج لبرا؟,"""Don't you see? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body.",don't you know what you need to do to get in the mouth
أما داكشي اللي كيخرج من الفم، راه كيخرج من القلب وهو اللي كينجس بنادم. متى,But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. Those are the things that make you 'unclean.',"But that's why he came out of the mouth, he's coming out of the heart and he's talking to regret."
علاحقاش من القلب كتخرج الأفكار الخايبة: بحال القتيلة، والفساد ديال المزوجين وديال اللي ما مزوجينش، والسرقة، وشهادة الزور، والسبان.,"Evil thoughts come out of the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do stealing, false witness, and telling lies about others.","It's from the heart that you get the wrong ideas: in the case of the dead, the corruption of the married couple and the debauchery, the theft, the false testimony, and the Spanish."

وخرج يسوع من تم ومشى لجوايه صور وصيدا.,Jesus left Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon.,And Jesus went out from the roof of the photos and of Saida.
وهي تجي عنده واحد المراة كنعانية من هادوك الجوايه، وغوتات وݣالت: «رحمني آ سيدي آ بن داود! راه بنتي ساكنها جن كيعدبها بزاف».,"A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, ""Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon controls my daughter. She is suffering terribly.""","She comes to him with a woman who is suffering from these groceries, and she goes and she says: he has mercy on me, sir, the son of David!"
ولكن ما جاوبها حتى بكلمة. وقربو ليه تلامده وطلبوه وݣالو: «صيفطها بحالها، علاحقاش تابعانا وكتغوت!».,"Jesus did not say a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him, ""Send her away. She keeps crying out after us.""","But he didn't bring it up a word, and they brought it to him and asked him and asked him and asked for it:"
وجاوبهم يسوع وݣال: «ما صيفطني الله غير للخرفان الموضرين ديال شعب إسرائيل».,"Jesus answered, ""I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.""",Jesus and his people answered: I think it is only true that the people of Israel are proud.
ولكن جات ديك المراة وسجدات ليه وݣالت: «عاوني آ سيدي!»,"Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. ""Lord! Help me!"" she said.",But this woman came and she went to her house and helped me to help me sir!
وجاوبها وݣال: «ماشي معقول يتخاد خبز الولاد ويترمى للكلاب»,"He replied, ""It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs.""",he answered and said:
وݣالت ليه المراة: «إيه آ سيدي! ولكن راه حتى الكلاب كياكلو من الفراتت اللي كيطيحو من الميادي ديال ماليهم».,"""Yes, Lord,"" she said. ""But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owners' table.""",And she told her: sir!
وجاوبها يسوع وݣال: «إيمانك كبير آ هاد المراة! غادي يكون ليك داكشي اللي بغيتي». وديك الساعة تشافات ليها بنتها. بزاف د الناس كيتشافاو,"Then Jesus answered, ""Woman, you have great faith! You will be given what you are asking for."" And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand",And you will have what you want. And you have the time to heal her daughter.
ومن بعد، مشى يسوع من تم لجنب البحر ديال الجليل، وطلع للجبل وݣلس تم.,Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.,"And then, Jesus went from the sea side to the boiler, and he went to the mountain and went to bed."
وجاو لعنده جماعات كتار د الناس ومعاهم عرجين وعميين وزحافا وزيازن وناس خرين كتار، وحطوهم عند رجليه وشفاهم.,"Large crowds came to him. They brought blind people and those who could not walk. They also brought disabled people, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.","And he came to have many crowds of people with them who are blind and angry, and who are more and more people, and he took them by his feet and their lips."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس حيت شافو الزيازن كيتكلمو، والعرجين كيتشافاو، والزحافا كيمشيو، والعميين كيشوفو، وعطاو العز لإلاه إسرائيل. يسوع كيوكل ربعالاف واحد,The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were made well. Those not able to walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.,"And the crowds wonder how many people are waiting for them to speak, how many people are talking, how many are there, how many people are looking, blind people are looking at them, and they give pride to the god of Israel."
وعيط يسوع على تلامده وݣال ليهم: «بقاو في هاد الناس، علاحقاش تلت يام هادي وهم معاي، وما عندهم ما ياكلو. وما بغيتش نصيفطهم جيعانين باش ما يسخفوش فالطريق».,"Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, ""I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home.""","He told them to stay in this room, he didnt eat with me, he didnt eat it, he didnt eat it."
وهم يݣولو ليه تلامده: «منين غادي نجيبو فهاد الخلا الخبز اللي يشبع جماعة كبيرة بحال هادي؟»،,"His disciples answered him. ""There is nothing here,"" they said. ""Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?""",And they're waiting for him to heal him: who are we going to bring in the bread that fills a large crowd like this?
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «شحال من خبزة عندكم؟»، وجاوبوه: «سبعة د الخبزات وشي حوتات صغار».,"""How many loaves do you have?"" Jesus asked.  ""Seven,"" they replied, ""and a few small fish.""",And what is the matter with Jesus: how much bread do you have?
وآمر يسوع الجماعة د الناس باش يݣلسو للأرض،,Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.,"And Jesus ordered the group that people touch the ground,"
وخدا هادوك سبعة د الخبزات والحوتات، وشكر الله وقطعهم وعطى لتلامده، وتلامده عطاو للجماعات د الناس.,He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people.,"And they took seven of the bread and whales, and god thanked and cut them off and gave them to his students, and gave him a visit to the people's groups."
وكلاو كلهم حتى شبعو، وهزو سبعة د الݣفات عامرين بالطروف د الخبز اللي شاطو.,"All of them ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces.","And eat them all until they're full, and they rocked the seven of them with a lot of bread."
وكانو الناس اللي كلاو ربعالاف واحد من غير العيالات والولاد.,"The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.",It's people who have quarter of thousands of kids and children.
وملي صيفط يسوع الجماعات د الناس، ركب فالفلوكة وجا لجوايه بلاد مجدان.,"After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan.","And when Jesus asked the people, he took the floppy and came to a rich country."
الفصل سطاش علامات الزمان,Jesus Is Asked for a Miraculous Sign,the season has been marked by time
وجاو لعند يسوع شي وحدين من الفريسيين والصدوقيين باش يجربوه، وطلبو منه يبين ليهم شي علامة من السما. متى,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.,"And they came to Jesus and two of the Frisians and his friends to try him, and asked him to show him a sign of poison."
ولكن هو جاوبهم وݣال: «ملي كتغرب الشمس كتݣولو: الجو غيكون صافي، علاحقاش السما حمرا.,"He replied, ""In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be good weather. The sky is red.'",But he answered them and asked:
وفالصباح بكري كتݣولو: اليوم غادي تكون الشتا، علاحقاش السما حمرا ومضببة. كتعرفو تفسرو حالة الجو، ولكن علامات الزمان ما كتقدروش تفسروهم!,"And in the morning you say, 'Today it will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now.","And the morning is early, so if only: today you will be late, the poison will be red and pulsed. You know how to explain the weather, but the signs of time wont be able to explain them!"
جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة، وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة يونان». ومن بعد خلاهم يسوع ومشى. متى 12‏:39؛ لوقا 11‏:29 خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين,"An evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.""  Then Jesus left them and went away. The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees","a young generation is ugly and corrupt to ask for a sign, and it will not even give him a sign without the sign of the Greeks."
وملي وصلو التلامد للجهة لخرى من البحر، نساو ياخدو معاهم الخبز.,The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread.,"And they came to another side of the sea, they took bread with them."
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «ردو البال، حضيو راسكم من خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين!». لوقا,"""Be careful,"" Jesus said to them. ""Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.""","And Jesus Christ is interested: take care of yourself, get your head off of the wine of the Fresians and the Sads!"
وهم يݣولو مع راسهم: «كيݣول لينا هاد الكلام علاحقاش ما خديناش معانا الخبز».,"The disciples talked about this among themselves. They said, ""He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread.""",They are working together with their head: we need to talk like this if we don't have to eat bread.
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «علاش آ قلالين الإيمان كتݣولو فخاطركم: ما عندنا خبز؟,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, ""Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?",Jesus knew how and what to do with them: why don't you believe in him if you think of him: we don't have bread?
واش مازال ما فهمتو؟ واش ما عقلتوش على خمسة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على خمسالاف واحد، وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو من الطروف د الخبز؟ متى,"Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?",Do you still understand?
وما عقلتوش على سبعة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على ربعالاف واحد وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو؟ متى,"Don't you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?",When did the seven breads split up on the quarter a thousand and a bunch of buns have been collected?
كيفاش ما قدرتوش تفهمو بلي أنا ما كنتش كنقصد بكلامي ليكم الخبز؟ حضيو راسكم من خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين!».,"How can you possibly not understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.""",how could you not understand that I dont mean to talk to you about bread?
وديك الساعة، عاد فهمو تلامده بلي ݣال ليهم يحضيو راسهم من تعليم الفريسيين والصدوقيين، ماشي من خميرة الخبز. بطرس كيشهد بلي يسوع هو المسيح,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ,"And this clock, they came back and fed it to me that they had to bring their heads from the teaching of the Frisians and the Sads, that's not the breadsticks."
وملي وصل يسوع لجوايه قيصرية فيلبس، سول تلامده: «شكون هو ولد الإنسان فنضر الناس؟»,"Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say the Son of Man is?""","And how did Jesus get to the caesarean section of Phelps, where he found himself:"
وهم يجاوبوه: «شي منهم كيݣول: يوحنا المعمدان، وشي كيݣول: النبي إيليا، ووحدين خرين كيݣولو: النبي إرميا ولا شي واحد من الأنبيا». متى,"They replied, ""Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.""","And they come to him: they are going to say something to him: John the Baptist, they are going to say: the prophet Elia, and they are going to go to him: the prophet Irma, and none of him is an prophet."
وسولهم: «ونتم شكون أنا فنضركم؟».,"""But what about you?"" he asked. ""Who do you say I am?""",And ask them: why do you think I'm looking for you?
وجاوب سمعان بطرس وݣال: «نت هو المسيح ولد الله الحي!»، يوحنا,"Simon Peter answered, ""You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God.""",And Simon Peter and I answered: he is Christ and he is born alive!
وݣال ليه يسوع: «سعداتك آ سمعان بن يونا! علاحقاش ماشي شي بنادم اللي وراك هاد الحقيقة، ولكن با اللي فالسماوات هو اللي وراها ليك.,"Jesus replied, ""Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! No mere man showed this to you. My Father in heaven showed it to you.","what happened to him is the truth, but what happened to the sky is what happened to you."
وأنا راني نݣول ليك: نت بطرس، وعلى هاد الصخرة غادي نبني كنيستي، وقوة الموت ما غتقدرش عليها.,Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.,"I'm telling you: you are Peter, and this rock will build a church, and the force of death is not capable of it."
وغنعطيك سوارت مملكة السماوات، كل حاجة غتربطها فالأرض غادي تكون مربوطة فالسماوات، وكل حاجة غتحلها فالأرض غادي تكون محلولة فالسماوات». متى,"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.""","And I will give you the Kingdom of Heaven's bracelets, all the things you need to tie up in the land are bound in the skysights, and all the things you need to do in the land will be solved in the sky."
ومن بعد وصى يسوع تلامده باش ما يݣولو لحتى شي حد بلي هو المسيح. يسوع كيتنبأ بالموت والبعت دياله,Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus Tells About His Coming Death,"And after the command of Jesus he didnt lie to him until he didn't come to me; he is the Christ, so that he will predict death and sell his goods."
ومن ديك الساعة، بدا يسوع كيبين لتلامده بلي خاصه يمشي لأورشليم ويتعدب بزاف على يد الشيوخ والرؤسا د رجال الدين والعلما د الشرع، وخاصه يتقتل، وفاليوم التالت غيتبعت من الموت.,"From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again.","And from this hour, Jesus began to insult him especially when he went to Jerusalem and he was too tired at the hands of the elders and the leaders of the religious men and the science of the law, especially when he was killed, and the next day he was followed by death."
وجره بطرس للجنب وبدا كيخاصم عليه وكيݣول: «حاشا آ سيدي باش يطرا ليك هادشي!»،,"Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. ""Never, Lord!"" he said. ""This will never happen to you!""",Peter dragged him to the side and started to argue with him and say:
وهو يتلفت وݣال لبطرس: «بعد مني آ هاد الشيطان! نت راك سباب عترة لي، علاحقاش كتفكر فأمور الناس ماشي فأمور الله».,"Jesus turned and said to Peter, ""Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You do not have in mind the things of God. Instead, you are thinking about human things.""",He is spoiled and hurts me: after me is the devil!
وهو يݣول يسوع لتلامده: «إلا بغا شي واحد يتبعني، خاصه يسمح فراسه ويهز الصليب دياله ويتبعني، متى,"Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, ""If anyone wants to follow me, he must say no to himself. He must pick up his cross and follow me.","And he told Jesus to follow him and to follow me when,"
علاحقاش اللي بغا ينجي حياته غيضيعها، ولكن اللي ضيع حياته على قبلي غيلقاها. متى,"If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.","who will spend his life trying to make it happen, but who will spend his life before me will make it happen."
آش من نفع عند بنادم إلا ربح الدنيا كلها وضيع حياته؟ ولا آش غادي يعطي بنادم فعوض حياته؟,"""What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses his soul? Or what can anyone trade for his soul?",What good do you have if he wins all the world and loses his life?

ومن بعد ست يام، دا يسوع بطرس ويعقوب وخوه يوحنا، وطلعهم بوحدهم لواحد الجبل عالي.,"After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were all alone.","And then six days later, Jesus did Peter and James and his brother John, and he brought them alone to a mountain of highs."

His clothes became as white as the light.,"And the shape changed before them, and they put his face like the sun, and his clothes and his eggs like lights."
وهو يبان ليهم موسى وإيليا كيتكلمو مع يسوع.,Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.,And he showed them Moses and Elia to speak with Jesus.
وݣال بطرس ليسوع: «شحال مزيان نبقاو هنا آ سيدي. إلا بغيتي، نصايب هنا تلاتة د النوايل، وحدة ليك ووحدة لموسى ووحدة لإيليا».,"Peter said to Jesus, ""Lord, it is good for us to be here.

وفالوقت فاش كان كيتكلم ضللات عليهم واحد السحابة مضوية، وتكلم صوت من السحابة وݣال: «هادا هو ولدي العزيز اللي بيه فرحت بزاف، سمعو ليه!». 2بطرس 1‏:17‏،18,"While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud surrounded them. A voice from the cloud said, ""This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!""","And at the time it was too late to speak the thoughts of the cloud, and speak the voice of the cloud and: this is my dear son who is very happy, they listen to him!"
وملي سمعو التلامد هادشي، طاحو على وجوههم وخافو بزاف.,"When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell with their faces to the ground.",And they heard the noises on their faces and they scared too much.
