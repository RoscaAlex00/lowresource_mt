The people there had not turned away from their sins. So he said,","And you have the watch, and it seemed like a lot of other people wrote miracles in them, and people lived in a lot of places."
«يا ويلك آ كورزين! ويا ويلك آ بيت صيدا! كون المعجزات اللي تدارو فيكم تدارو فصور وفصيدا، كون شحال هادي تابو ماليهم، وكون لبسو الخيش وݣلسو على الرماد # 11‏:21 لبسو الخيش وݣلسو على الرماد: باش يبينو التوبة ديالهم .,"""How terrible it will be for you, Korazin!

الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,the chapter is hard for him to learn on the Saturday
وفديك ليام، فواحد السبت، داز يسوع بين الفدادن د الزرع، وكان فتلامده الجوع، وهم يبداو كيقطعو السبول وكياكلو.,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"Your parents are working on a Saturday night, and he is hungry, and they are starting to cut the urine and eat a lot of food."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!""",I'm waiting for the prey for you to see if you can find anything special they want to do on Saturday!
ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.","they answered, ""What do you think of the house of David for hunger is with him and those who are with him?"""
وكيفاش دخل لبيت الله، وكلا الخبز اللي كيقدموه لله، اللي ما كانش خاص ياكله لا هو ولا هادوك اللي معاه من غير رجال الدين بوحدهم.,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how did he go to the house of God, and both the bread they gave to God, which he did not eat, neither did he, nor did he eat with you, who is not a religious person alone."
واش ما قريتوش فالتوراة بلي رجال الدين وهم كيخدمو فبيت الله نهار السبت، كيتعداو على السبت، وواخا داكشي ما عليهم لوم؟,Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"what do you want to do with the men of religion when they are working in the house on Saturday nights, to go on Saturdays, and to go to school to blame them?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.",But I will tell you: this is where he grew up from the house of God.
وكون فهمتو المعنى ديال الآية اللي كتݣول: بغيت الرحمة ماشي الدبيحة، كون ݣاع ما حكمتو على اللي ما عليهم لوم.,"Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.","And if you understand the meaning of the text that was written in this book: I want mercy for the sake of the cheerleader, if you do not judge what they are blaming."
حيت ولد الإنسان هو الرب ديال السبت». يسوع كيشافي فنهار السبت,"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.""",the son of a man is the Lord of the Sabbath
ومشى من تم وجا لدار الصلاة ديالهم،,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.",he went to the house to pray
ولقا واحد الراجل يده مشلولة. وهم يسولوه وݣالو: «واش حلال الشفا نهار السبت؟» سولوه باش يلقاو عليه شي تهمة.,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""","One man is paralyzed, and they ask him and he asks: what are you talking about on Saturday?"
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?","he answered: why is there only one of you who has one sheep and has a hole in him on Saturday morning, what do you want to shake him and bring him out?"
إيوا راه قيمة بنادم كتر بزاف من الخروف! وهادشي علاش عمل الخير حلال نهار السبت».,"A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.""",i think he's worth more than a lot of sheep and that's why he did good work on Saturday nights.
وݣال يسوع للراجل اللي يده مشلولة: «مد يدك!» ومدها، وهي تولي صحيحة بحال اليد لخرى.,"Then Jesus said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.",Jesus is asking the man who is paralyzed: reach your hand!
وخرجو الفريسيين كيتافقو كيفاش يقتلوه. يسوع هو المختار من الله,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant,he went out to see how he will kill him. Jesus is the chosen man from God.
وملي ساق يسوع الخبار، مشى من تم وتبعوه جماعات كتار من الناس، وشفاهم كلهم.,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.","Jesus told him the news, who was followed by many people, and he told them all of them."
ووصاهم باش ما يخبرو حد عليه.,But he warned them not to tell who he was.,He told them what to tell him.
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,",what are you talking about?
«ها هو عبدي اللي ختاريت،  العزيز ديالي اللي بيه نفسي فرحات بزاف.  غادي نحط عليه روحي،  وغيخبر الشعوب بالحق.,"""Here is my servant. I have chosen him.  He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.","he is my servant who has chosen, my dear friend who has shown me the joys of my soul and has told the people the truth."
ما غيتخاصم وما غيغوت،  حتى حد ما غيسمع صوته فالزناقي.,He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.,"I didn't fight and I didn't fight, so I can hear his voice in the rings."
قصبة مشقوقة ما غيهرس،  وفتيلة كتطلق الدخان ما غيطفي،  حتى يرد الحق هو اللي غالب.,He will not break a bent twig.  He will not put out a dimly burning flame.  He will make everything right.,"a rattled cane isn't well, and a girl who smokes isn't good enough, so the truth is what he is most likely to say."
وفالإسم دياله غيديرو الشعوب رجاهم». يسوع وبعلزبول,"The nations will put their hope in him."" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub",And in the name of the people did they ask them:
وجابو شي ناس ليسوع واحد الراجل عمى وزيزون وساكنه جن، وهو يشافيه، وهكا ولى قادر يتكلم ويشوف.,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.,"And people told him that the man is blind, that he is sick and that he is sick, that he is sick to speak and to see."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس وݣالو: «ياكما هادا هو بن داود؟».,"All the people were amazed. They said, ""Could this be the Son of David?""",The people are impressed by this group and they are the son of David?
وملي سمعو الفريسيين هادشي ݣالو: «هادا راه ما كيخرج الجنون غير ببعلزبول رئيس الجنون». متى 9‏:34؛ 10‏:25,"The Pharisees heard this. So they said, ""This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.""",they heard the freaks say this is not going crazy except for the head of the madman.
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «كل مملكة كتقسم كتخرب، وكل مدينة ولا عائلة كتقسم ما غتدومش.,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","Jesus knew how to treat them: every kingdom is divided as a ruin, every city is divided and no family is divided."
إيوا إلا كان الشيطان كيخرج الشيطان، غادي يكون الشيطان تقسم وولى ضد راسه، وإلا تقسم وولى ضد راسه كيفاش غادي تبقى مملكته تابتة؟,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?","If only the devil were to bring out the devil, he will be sworn against his head, or he will be sworn against his head, how will his kingdom remain silent?"
وإلا كنت أنا ببعلزبول كنخرج الجنون، إيوا شكون هادا اللي ولادكم كيخرجوهم بيه؟ على هادشي راه ولادكم اللي غادي يحكمو عليكم.,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.","otherwise I'm going to go crazy, I'm going to tell you what you have to do to get them out of here."
ولكن إلا كنت أنا بروح الله كنخرج الجنون، راه مملكة الله جات فوسط منكم.,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.,"But if only I were in God's spirit to go out mad, the kingdom of God came from you."
وكيفاش يقدر شي حد يدخل لدار شي واحد صحيح ويسرق ليه حوايجه بلا ما يكتفه فاللول، وعاد يسرق ليه داره؟,"""Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.",how can anyone enter the house of one thing that is right and steal his clothes without enough money and steal his house back?
اللي ماشي معاي راه ضدي، واللي ما كيجمعش معاي راه كيفرق. مرقس 9‏:40,"""Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.","why don't you go against me, why don't you bring him to work with me"
داكشي علاش نݣول ليكم: كل دنب وكل كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال غيتغفر للناس، ولكن كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال على الروح القدس ما غيتغفرش.,So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.,"I dont want to tell you: all the infidels you have been asking for is forgiveness for people, but the infidel you have been trying to forgive the holy spirit is not to forgive you."
اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد ولد الإنسان غيتغفر ليه، ولكن اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد الروح القدس ما غاديش يتغفر ليه لا فهاد الدنيا ولا فلاخرة». لوقا 12‏:10 الشجرة وغلتها,Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.,"what is the word against the son of man to forgive him, but what is the word against the holy spirit that will not forgive him?"

بنادم المزيان كيخرج الحوايج المزيانين من الكنز المزيان اللي فقلبه، وبنادم الخايب كيخرج الحوايج الخايبين من الكنز الخايب اللي فقلبه.,A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.,"I regret the favors to get the good stuff out of the good treasure, and I regret the bad stuff to get the bad stuff out of the bad treasure that happened to him."
ونݣول ليكم: راه كل هضرة خاوية كيݣولوها الناس، غادي يتحاسبو عليها فيوم الحساب.,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.","I'll tell you what it's all right to say it to the people, they will charge it on the count."

But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.","And he will say to them, ""Owful and corrupt generation will ask for a sign, and you will not give him a sign other than the sign of the prophet."""

Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.,"there is no child of man, and he turned the earth after him and followed my nights."

So the people praised the God of Israel.,"The crowds are impressed that the people are alive to speak, and the limps are talking, they are talking, they are looking for them, they are looking for them, they are blind to the god of Israel."

وجاو لعند يسوع شي وحدين من الفريسيين والصدوقيين باش يجربوه، وطلبو منه يبين ليهم شي علامة من السما. متى,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.,"And he came with him, and he alone of the prey and his friends, that they should try him, and they asked him to show him a sign of the poison: when"
ولكن هو جاوبهم وݣال: «ملي كتغرب الشمس كتݣولو: الجو غيكون صافي، علاحقاش السما حمرا.,"He replied, ""In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be good weather. The sky is red.'",But he answered them and asked:

But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.""  Then Jesus left them and went away.

He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ,"And you have the hour, and they come back and give it to them that they should have their head from teaching the prey and the saucers, that they should not eat bread."
وملي وصل يسوع لجوايه قيصرية فيلبس، سول تلامده: «شكون هو ولد الإنسان فنضر الناس؟»,"Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say the Son of Man is?""",how did Jesus arrive at the caesarean section of the house?

He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again.","From this hour on, Jesus began to complain to him in private and to go to Jerusalem and to suffer too much at the hands of the elders and presidents of religion and science, and to kill him, and the next day I will follow him from the dead."
وجره بطرس للجنب وبدا كيخاصم عليه وكيݣول: «حاشا آ سيدي باش يطرا ليك هادشي!»،,"Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. ""Never, Lord!"" he said. ""This will never happen to you!""",And he brought him to the side and he started to argue with him and to say:

He must pick up his cross and follow me.",And he is going to teach Jesus to follow him when he will follow me
علاحقاش اللي بغا ينجي حياته غيضيعها، ولكن اللي ضيع حياته على قبلي غيلقاها. متى,"If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.","i will not spend my life waiting for her, but i will spend his life before her."
