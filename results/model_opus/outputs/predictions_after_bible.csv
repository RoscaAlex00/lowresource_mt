«آ بلاد زبولون وبلاد نفتالي،  اللي فطريق البحر من الجهة لخرى ديال واد الأردن،  بلاد الجليل ديال الشعوب اللي ماشي يهود!,"""Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali!  Galilee, where non-Jewish people live!  Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Territory east of the Jordan River!","the country of Zabulon and the country of Neftali, which is on the seaway from the side to the other side of the country of Jordan, the country of Galilee is the country of people who are not Jewish!"

They are now living in a very dark land.  But a light will shine on them."" (Isaiah 9:1,2)","The people who wanna sit in the dark are looking for a great light, and who are living in the country of death and in the middle of it, they will have one light left."

There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake. They were fishermen.,"And he told him that he would be on the side of the sea of Galilee, looking for his grove, hearing what Peter and his brother were able to throw at the sea, after which he was a fisherman of the whale."
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «تبعوني، وأنا نردكم صيادا ديال الناس».,"""Come. Follow me,"" Jesus said. ""I will make you fishers of people.""","And I care about Jesus: they followed me, and I want you to fish for people."

They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. As they were preparing their nets, Jesus called out to them.","And then, who went to go to got two others, they were Jacob son of Zeppebdi and his brother of John, with a lot of money in a joke to fix their window."
وهم يخليو الفلوكة وباهم وتبعو يسوع. يسوع كيعلم وكيشافي,Right away they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus Heals Sick People,"and they leave money and money and follow Jesus, so that he may know and know"
ومشى يسوع لكل موضع فبلاد الجليل، كيعلم فديور الصلاة اللي تم وكيخبر بالبشارة ديال مملكة الله، وكيشافي الناس من كل مرض وكل ضعف. متى,Jesus went all over Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues. He preached the good news of God's kingdom. He healed every illness and sickness the people had.,"Jesus walked to every place in the country of Galilee, so that he knew what prayer had been made, that he told the good news of God's Kingdom, and that he taught people every sickness and every weakness."

People brought to him all who were ill with different kinds of sicknesses. Some were suffering great pain. Others were controlled by demons. Some were shaking wildly. Others couldn't move at all. And Jesus healed all of them.,"I said goodbye to him all over Syria, and he brought his patients who were sick because they were sick: the poor, the rest of them for wind and the sick, and he is healing them."
وتبعوه بزاف د الجماعات من الجليل، والمدون العشرة، وأورشليم، وبلاد اليهودية، ومن الجهة لخرى ديال واد الأردن.,"Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the area known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the area across the Jordan River.","He was followed by many groups from Galilee, the ten blogs, Jerusalem, the Jewish country and the other side to the Jordan Valley."

وملي مشاو تلامد يوحنا بحالهم، بدا يسوع كيتكلم مع الجماعات د الناس على يوحنا وݣال: «آش خرجتو تشوفو فالصحرا؟ واش شي قصبة كتديها الريح وكتجيبها؟,"As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, ""What did you go out into the desert to see? Tall grass waving in the wind?","And when he went to reach out to John, he started to talk to the people of John and his people: why did you go to the desert? What is the story of the wind and answer it?"
ولا آش خرجتو تشوفو؟ واش شي راجل لابس لباس رفيع؟ حيت اللي كيلبسو اللباس الرفيع، هادوك راهم ساكنين فقصور الملوك!,"If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.",Do you want to go see if a man is dressed in thin clothes?
ݣولو لي آش خرجتو تشوفو؟ واش شي نبي؟ نݣول ليكم إيه، راه نبي وكتر من نبي.,"Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.","If only you had to go outside? Is there a prophet? I'll tell you what, it's a prophet and a lot of prophet."
وراه هادا هو اللي ݣال عليه الله فكتابه: هاني غنصيفط الرسول ديالي قدامك، اللي غيوجد ليك الطريق.,"He is the one written about in Scripture. It says, "" 'I will send my messenger ahead of you.  He will prepare your way for you.' (Malachi 3:1)","And this is what God has told him in his book: I'm waiting for my messenger before you, who will find the road for you."
ونݣول ليكم الحق: ما بانش من بين اللي تزادو من العيالات شي واحد حسن من يوحنا المعمدان، ولكن الصغير ݣاع فمملكة السماوات راه خير منه.,"""What I'm about to tell you is true. No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is.","And I tell you the truth: there is no one better than John the Baptist, but the young man is better off in the Kingdom of the heavens than he is."
ومن يام يوحنا المعمدان حتى لليوم ومملكة السماوات كتكبر بالقوة، والقويين كيديرو جهدهم باش يخطفوها. لوقا,"Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with force. And forceful people are taking hold of it.","And from Yam John the Baptist even for today and the kingdom of the heavens is as strong as they are strong, and the strong they are doing their best to kidnap it."
وݣاع الأنبيا وشرع موسى تنبأو حتى للوقت اللي جا فيه يوحنا المعمدان.,All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came.,And the prophets began to predict even when John the baptist came.

The people there had not turned away from their sins. So he said,","And for the hour, it seemed that Jesus Kiloam had many miracles for others, and people were not happy."

الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,the chapter is beautiful for him to know on a Saturday
وفديك ليام، فواحد السبت، داز يسوع بين الفدادن د الزرع، وكان فتلامده الجوع، وهم يبداو كيقطعو السبول وكياكلو.,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"Your guest is today, on Saturday, when Jesus was born and he was hungry and they started to cut the urine and eat it."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!""",And they saw a few of the preys who were waiting for you on Saturdays!
ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.",They were told that there is no village in which David is hungry because he is with him?
وكيفاش دخل لبيت الله، وكلا الخبز اللي كيقدموه لله، اللي ما كانش خاص ياكله لا هو ولا هادوك اللي معاه من غير رجال الدين بوحدهم.,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he went into the house of God, and both the bread they gave to God, which he didn't have to eat, neither he nor those who were with him other than the clergy alone."
واش ما قريتوش فالتوراة بلي رجال الدين وهم كيخدمو فبيت الله نهار السبت، كيتعداو على السبت، وواخا داكشي ما عليهم لوم؟,Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"Don't you think it's good to see the religious men who are working in the house of God on Saturdays, to get off on Saturdays, and the brother doesn't blame them?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.","But I'm telling you, this is where he grew up from God's house."
وكون فهمتو المعنى ديال الآية اللي كتݣول: بغيت الرحمة ماشي الدبيحة، كون ݣاع ما حكمتو على اللي ما عليهم لوم.,"Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.","And if you understand the meaning of the verse that was written in the first place: you want mercy to go to the beach, you will not judge anyone who is not to blame them."
حيت ولد الإنسان هو الرب ديال السبت». يسوع كيشافي فنهار السبت,"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.""","When a man is born, he is the Lord of the Sabbath."
ومشى من تم وجا لدار الصلاة ديالهم،,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.","And who went to their house of prayer,"
ولقا واحد الراجل يده مشلولة. وهم يسولوه وݣالو: «واش حلال الشفا نهار السبت؟» سولوه باش يلقاو عليه شي تهمة.,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""",One man found his hand crippled. They asked him and asked if he was able to explain on Saturday.
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?","They answered: if only one of you had a sheep and he fell in a hole on Saturday, he wouldn't like to shake it and bring it out?"
إيوا راه قيمة بنادم كتر بزاف من الخروف! وهادشي علاش عمل الخير حلال نهار السبت».,"A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.""",It is worth a lot of sheep! It is good work on Saturday.
وݣال يسوع للراجل اللي يده مشلولة: «مد يدك!» ومدها، وهي تولي صحيحة بحال اليد لخرى.,"Then Jesus said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.","The man who is paralyzed by the hand of Jesus is able to extend your hand and stretch it, and she is right for the hand of another."
وخرجو الفريسيين كيتافقو كيفاش يقتلوه. يسوع هو المختار من الله,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant,And go out the prey so that they will wait for him to be killed. Jesus is the chosen one from God.
وملي ساق يسوع الخبار، مشى من تم وتبعوه جماعات كتار من الناس، وشفاهم كلهم.,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.","And tell Jesus the news leg, who was followed by a lot of people, and he saw them all."
ووصاهم باش ما يخبرو حد عليه.,But he warned them not to tell who he was.,He told them what to tell him.
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,",What is the words of the prophet Isaiah:
«ها هو عبدي اللي ختاريت،  العزيز ديالي اللي بيه نفسي فرحات بزاف.  غادي نحط عليه روحي،  وغيخبر الشعوب بالحق.,"""Here is my servant. I have chosen him.  He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.","It is my servant whom I have chosen, my dearest friend who has so much joy. I will send him my soul, and he will tell the people the truth."
ما غيتخاصم وما غيغوت،  حتى حد ما غيسمع صوته فالزناقي.,He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.,I don't want to fight and I don't want to talk to him anymore.
قصبة مشقوقة ما غيهرس،  وفتيلة كتطلق الدخان ما غيطفي،  حتى يرد الحق هو اللي غالب.,He will not break a bent twig.  He will not put out a dimly burning flame.  He will make everything right.,"A cracked cane isn't clear, and a girl who smokes isn't right, so the right is the best."
وفالإسم دياله غيديرو الشعوب رجاهم». يسوع وبعلزبول,"The nations will put their hope in him."" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub",In the name of his people he made them happy.
وجابو شي ناس ليسوع واحد الراجل عمى وزيزون وساكنه جن، وهو يشافيه، وهكا ولى قادر يتكلم ويشوف.,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.,"He brought some people to a man who was blind and sick and was sick, he heals him, and he is able to speak and see him."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس وݣالو: «ياكما هادا هو بن داود؟».,"All the people were amazed. They said, ""Could this be the Son of David?""",And the crowd wonders and wonders: how much is this the son of David?
وملي سمعو الفريسيين هادشي ݣالو: «هادا راه ما كيخرج الجنون غير ببعلزبول رئيس الجنون». متى 9‏:34؛ 10‏:25,"The Pharisees heard this. So they said, ""This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.""",They heard the cheerleaders who said that they didn't go crazy except for the head of the crazy.
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «كل مملكة كتقسم كتخرب، وكل مدينة ولا عائلة كتقسم ما غتدومش.,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","Jesus knew how and how to do it: every kingdom is divided as a ruin, and every city and family is divided as it is not done."
إيوا إلا كان الشيطان كيخرج الشيطان، غادي يكون الشيطان تقسم وولى ضد راسه، وإلا تقسم وولى ضد راسه كيفاش غادي تبقى مملكته تابتة؟,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?","If only the devil were to take out the devil, he would be sworn against his head, or he would be sworn against his head how will his kingdom survive?"
وإلا كنت أنا ببعلزبول كنخرج الجنون، إيوا شكون هادا اللي ولادكم كيخرجوهم بيه؟ على هادشي راه ولادكم اللي غادي يحكمو عليكم.,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.","If only I were to go crazy, who would complain that you were born to bring them out?"
ولكن إلا كنت أنا بروح الله كنخرج الجنون، راه مملكة الله جات فوسط منكم.,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.,"But if I are in God's spirit to go crazy, then the kingdom of God comes in the middle of you."
وكيفاش يقدر شي حد يدخل لدار شي واحد صحيح ويسرق ليه حوايجه بلا ما يكتفه فاللول، وعاد يسرق ليه داره؟,"""Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.","How can someone go into the house of someone who is right and steals his clothes without having enough of his money, and then steals his house back?"
اللي ماشي معاي راه ضدي، واللي ما كيجمعش معاي راه كيفرق. مرقس 9‏:40,"""Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.","who is not with me against me, who is not with me"
داكشي علاش نݣول ليكم: كل دنب وكل كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال غيتغفر للناس، ولكن كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال على الروح القدس ما غيتغفرش.,So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.,"This is what I want you to do: every debt and all the talk of infidelity that I have made is forgiven people, but the talk of infidels that I have made on the holy spirit is not forgiven."
اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد ولد الإنسان غيتغفر ليه، ولكن اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد الروح القدس ما غاديش يتغفر ليه لا فهاد الدنيا ولا فلاخرة». لوقا 12‏:10 الشجرة وغلتها,Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.,"What is a word against the son of man you have forgiven him, but what is a word against the Holy Ghost that will never forgive him in this world or in a villain?"

بنادم المزيان كيخرج الحوايج المزيانين من الكنز المزيان اللي فقلبه، وبنادم الخايب كيخرج الحوايج الخايبين من الكنز الخايب اللي فقلبه.,A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.,"I regret the good stuff to get the good clothes out of the good treasure, and the bad ones out of the bad treasure."
ونݣول ليكم: راه كل هضرة خاوية كيݣولوها الناس، غادي يتحاسبو عليها فيوم الحساب.,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.","And let me tell you: every empty waste is to be taken care of by people, and they are going to charge for it on the day of the reckoning."

But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.",And he tells them: he is an ugly and corrupt generation to ask for a sign! She will not give him a sign without the sign of the prophet.
علاحقاش كما بقى يونان فكرش الحوتة تلت يام وتلت ليالي، هكا غادي يبقى ولد الإنسان فقلب الأرض تلت يام وتلت ليالي.,Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.,It is as though the whale was left behind in the day and in the nights that the son of man will be left behind in the ground after the day and the night after the night.
