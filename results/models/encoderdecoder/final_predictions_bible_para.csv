Right away the man was healed of his skin disease.","And he gave off his hands and said, 'What should I do? '"

وملي سمعه يسوع تعجب وݣال لهادوك اللي تابعينه: «نݣول ليكم الحق: ما لقيت حتى شي واحد فإسرائيل عنده إيمان قوي بحال هادا.,"When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those following him, ""What I'm about to tell you is true. In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong.",And as I can't say anyone in Casablanca is the strongest solution.

It will be done just as you believed it would.""  And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus Heals Many People","Then then he calls the crididays of milliver, then she'll be the same guest of your patients,"

وملي شاف يسوع الجماعة د الناس ضايرين بيه، آمر التلامد دياله باش يقطعو للجهة لخرى ديال البحر.,Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.,"And as he saw the guests around, he says his dream and his dresses to cut down the other side."

وهربو السراحا ومشاو للمدينة وخبرو بݣاع داكشي اللي جرا، وبداكشي اللي وقع للرجال اللي مسكونين بالجنون.,Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They went into the town and reported all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons.,And they ran into the city and asked about what happened.
