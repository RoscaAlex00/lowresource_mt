وكانت تم واحد المراة مريضة، طناشر عام وهي كتدوز بالدم، قربات ورا يسوع ومسات جلايله،,Just then a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a sickness that made her bleed. It had lasted for 12 years.

الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,The december is pretty accident for the Sunday.
وفديك ليام، فواحد السبت، داز يسوع بين الفدادن د الزرع، وكان فتلامده الجوع، وهم يبداو كيقطعو السبول وكياكلو.,One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"Some days, in a day he went too much too, and the salt was starting to cut down the liver, and she started eating."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!""",And then they saw him as your students were doing some smoking on the saturday next day!
ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.","And give them back, haven't you read what happened when he was with them?"
وكيفاش دخل لبيت الله، وكلا الخبز اللي كيقدموه لله، اللي ما كانش خاص ياكله لا هو ولا هادوك اللي معاه من غير رجال الدين بوحدهم.,So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he entered the prisonal men, eat the bread that we used to eat for their parties."
واش ما قريتوش فالتوراة بلي رجال الدين وهم كيخدمو فبيت الله نهار السبت، كيتعداو على السبت، وواخا داكشي ما عليهم لوم؟,Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"Didn't you read the earthquake men when they work in the saturday, or well, they're not looking at the morning?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.","But I'll tell you, he's here bigger than god."
وكون فهمتو المعنى ديال الآية اللي كتݣول: بغيت الرحمة ماشي الدبيحة، كون ݣاع ما حكمتو على اللي ما عليهم لوم.,"Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.",if you understand the worth of the sentence
حيت ولد الإنسان هو الرب ديال السبت». يسوع كيشافي فنهار السبت,"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day.""","because he is a good person, he is the same Sunday of Saturday"
ومشى من تم وجا لدار الصلاة ديالهم،,"Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.","He did go from there to praying at their home,"
ولقا واحد الراجل يده مشلولة. وهم يسولوه وݣالو: «واش حلال الشفا نهار السبت؟» سولوه باش يلقاو عليه شي تهمة.,"A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""","And they fought him a crazy person, and they asked about him in the morning."
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?",And then if one of you has one scammer and he didn't have it afternoon on Wednesday ?
إيوا راه قيمة بنادم كتر بزاف من الخروف! وهادشي علاش عمل الخير حلال نهار السبت».,"A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day.""","Well, it's more important people than the chicken, so I make good thursday."
وݣال يسوع للراجل اللي يده مشلولة: «مد يدك!» ومدها، وهي تولي صحيحة بحال اليد لخرى.,"Then Jesus said to the man, ""Stretch out your hand."" So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.","And she'll call the poor guy, and the last one, it'll be good to put it on the other hand."
وخرجو الفريسيين كيتافقو كيفاش يقتلوه. يسوع هو المختار من الله,But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant,The guests were talking about how to kill them. He's a good boy.
وملي ساق يسوع الخبار، مشى من تم وتبعوه جماعات كتار من الناس، وشفاهم كلهم.,"Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.","And he knows the news, he went away from her and followed many guests, and attacked all of them."
ووصاهم باش ما يخبرو حد عليه.,But he warned them not to tell who he was.,Punish them so they can ask no one about him.
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي إشعيا:,"This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,",to explain what said
«ها هو عبدي اللي ختاريت،  العزيز ديالي اللي بيه نفسي فرحات بزاف.  غادي نحط عليه روحي،  وغيخبر الشعوب بالحق.,"""Here is my servant. I have chosen him.  He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.","Absolutely, it's my deadline that I've choosed, and I'll be happy about my friends."
ما غيتخاصم وما غيغوت،  حتى حد ما غيسمع صوته فالزناقي.,He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.,It's just going to call and no one hears about the neighbors.
قصبة مشقوقة ما غيهرس،  وفتيلة كتطلق الدخان ما غيطفي،  حتى يرد الحق هو اللي غالب.,He will not break a bent twig.  He will not put out a dimly burning flame.  He will make everything right.,"The roads are so bad, and then the smoke can't make it anymore, until it's allowed."
وفالإسم دياله غيديرو الشعوب رجاهم». يسوع وبعلزبول,"The nations will put their hope in him."" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub",And his talk will make people love theirself well.
وجابو شي ناس ليسوع واحد الراجل عمى وزيزون وساكنه جن، وهو يشافيه، وهكا ولى قادر يتكلم ويشوف.,A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.,"And some people brought a blind man, and he was able to talk well."
وتعجبو الجماعات د الناس وݣالو: «ياكما هادا هو بن داود؟».,"All the people were amazed. They said, ""Could this be the Son of David?""",And then the seminars of people who said he's the last man?
وملي سمعو الفريسيين هادشي ݣالو: «هادا راه ما كيخرج الجنون غير ببعلزبول رئيس الجنون». متى 9‏:34؛ 10‏:25,"The Pharisees heard this. So they said, ""This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons.""","And when they listened to that, it's when the world called the curtain."
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «كل مملكة كتقسم كتخرب، وكل مدينة ولا عائلة كتقسم ما غتدومش.,"Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","And know what they think about, and tell them every family while you grow down."
إيوا إلا كان الشيطان كيخرج الشيطان، غادي يكون الشيطان تقسم وولى ضد راسه، وإلا تقسم وولى ضد راسه كيفاش غادي تبقى مملكته تابتة؟,"If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?","So what if the man was a man going back, and the men would have grew up again, and how would he be?"
وإلا كنت أنا ببعلزبول كنخرج الجنون، إيوا شكون هادا اللي ولادكم كيخرجوهم بيه؟ على هادشي راه ولادكم اللي غادي يحكمو عليكم.,"You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.","If I'm a fan of your kids, who will go outside the wild make you ?"
ولكن إلا كنت أنا بروح الله كنخرج الجنون، راه مملكة الله جات فوسط منكم.,But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.,"But if I'm now fool I go outside the birds, it's bad for you."
وكيفاش يقدر شي حد يدخل لدار شي واحد صحيح ويسرق ليه حوايجه بلا ما يكتفه فاللول، وعاد يسرق ليه داره؟,"""Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.","And how can anyone go home with their hands injured, and just get out of his clothes without getting his house dirty?"
اللي ماشي معاي راه ضدي، واللي ما كيجمعش معاي راه كيفرق. مرقس 9‏:40,"""Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.","What's not with me is upset, and then she doesn't gather for me."
داكشي علاش نݣول ليكم: كل دنب وكل كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال غيتغفر للناس، ولكن كلام الكفر اللي كيتݣال على الروح القدس ما غيتغفرش.,So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.,"That's why I'll tell you what the crime's going to deserve, but the discriminar's dishes won't be accepted."
اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد ولد الإنسان غيتغفر ليه، ولكن اللي ݣال شي كلمة ضد الروح القدس ما غاديش يتغفر ليه لا فهاد الدنيا ولا فلاخرة». لوقا 12‏:10 الشجرة وغلتها,Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.,he won't say him until he said a word
«غرسو شجرة مزيانة وغتكون غلتها مزيانة، ولا غرسو شجرة خايبة وغتكون غلتها خايبة. راه من الغلة كتعرف الشجرة. متى,"""If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.","There's a good tree, and then the challenge would have given it badly."
آ تريكة اللفاعي! كيفاش تقدرو تݣولو شي كلام مزيان ونتم ما مزيانينش؟ راه داكشي اللي كيخرج من القلب كيتكلم بيه الفم. متى,"""You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.","Well, how can you say a good word and not talk about it anymore?"
بنادم المزيان كيخرج الحوايج المزيانين من الكنز المزيان اللي فقلبه، وبنادم الخايب كيخرج الحوايج الخايبين من الكنز الخايب اللي فقلبه.,A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.,"Great people go out from beautiful things, and bad people think so much about his favorites."
ونݣول ليكم: راه كل هضرة خاوية كيݣولوها الناس، غادي يتحاسبو عليها فيوم الحساب.,"But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.","And I tell you, everyone talk about it, they'll be ruined for it on the day."
علاحقاش راه بكلامك غادي يتحكم عليك يا إما باري ويا إما مدنب». العلما د الشرع والفريسيين بغاو يشوفو شي علامة,"By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty."" The Miraculous Sign of Jonah","What about what's wrong is it going to make you proud of having or fiancee, or crazy for example."
وديك الساعة ردو عليه شي وحدين من العلما د الشرع والفريسيين وݣالو: «آ سيدي، راه بغينا نشوفو منك شي علامة». متى,"Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, ""Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.""",And then they call him a bit from the price and the curtains and the sentences.
وهو يݣول ليهم: «جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة! وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة النبي يونان. متى,"He answered, ""Evil and unfaithful people ask for a miraculous sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.",And then he tells them that a bad and bad day as a gift will be accepted!
علاحقاش كما بقى يونان فكرش الحوتة تلت يام وتلت ليالي، هكا غادي يبقى ولد الإنسان فقلب الأرض تلت يام وتلت ليالي.,Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.,"How about it, if he's left he'll be in the head for 4 days, and how much will he be inside the month of the world."
ناس نينوى غادي يتبعتو فيوم الحساب مع هاد الجيل ويشهدو عليه، علاحقاش هم تابو ملي نبههم يونان، وها هو دابا هنا واحد فضل من يونان.,"""The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now one who is more important than Jonah is here.","The old people will have touched it on the first day, and then they wil lcall him."
وملكة الجنوب غادية تبعت فيوم الحساب مع هاد الجيل وتشهد عليه، علاحقاش جات من أرض بعيدة باش تسمع حكمة سليمان، وها هو دابا هنا واحد فضل من سليمان.,"""The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to listen to Solomon's wisdom. And now one who is more important than Solomon is here.","And since the south, she's going to endure from this field, and then he's descrimined to listen to it, so I don't know what it is."
راه ملي كيخرج الجن من بنادم كيمشي يضور فبلايص ما فيهمش الما، كيقلب على الراحة وما كيلقاهاش،,"""What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find it.","It's when a man goes wandering from men to wanders, he looks for different water, and doesn't find it!"

The house has been swept clean and put in order.","And he tells me to get back home the only way she left, and he doesn't find her careful."
وكيمشي وكيدي معاه سبعة ديال الجنون خرين شر منه. وملي كيدخلو كيسكنو تم، وكتولي حالة هاداك بنادم اللخرانية كفس من حالته اللولانية. هادشي اللي غادي يطرا لهاد الجيل اللي كيدير الشر حتى هو». خوت يسوع ومه,"Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there. That man is worse off than before. That is how it will be with the evil people of today."" Jesus' Mother and Brothers",And that's why it doesn't happen so bad that thin many men double and it seems to be getting along in there.
وملي كان كيتكلم مع الجماعات د الناس، جات مه وخوته ووقفو برا باغيين يتكلمو معاه.  [,"While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to speak to him.","And when he talked to the administers, he and his friends came and stopped him."

ونعت بيده لجهة تلامده وݣال: «ها هم مي وخوتي،,"Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, ""Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!",and give him a list of students

وزاد عطاهم متال آخر وݣال: «كتشبه مملكة السماوات لخميرة خداتها واحد المراة وخلطاتها مع تلاتة كيلو ديال الطحين حتى خمرات العجينة كلها». يسوع كيتكلم بالمتول,"Jesus told them still another story. ""The kingdom of heaven is like yeast,"" he said. ""A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough.""",and the same sheep talked about irremore cause it was a piece of cake and it didn't mind it for three cats.
وهادشي كله ݣاله يسوع للجماعات د الناس بالمتول، وبلا متال ما كان كيݣول ليهم حتى حاجة،,Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd by using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.,"And all the way he said was forced the administration of deadlines, and didn't say anything."
باش يتحقق الكلام اللي ݣال النبي: «بالمتول نتكلم ونخبر بكل ما كان مخبي من النهار اللي تخلقات فيه الدنيا». المعنى د المتال ديال الزوان,"So the words spoken by the prophet came true. He had said, ""I will open my mouth and tell stories.  I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made."" (Psalm 78:2) Jesus Explains the Story of the Weeds","To explain what happened, the half should be honest and hurt all the time he had."
وديك الساعة خلا يسوع الجماعات ديال الناس ورجع للدار، وهم يجيو لعنده تلامده وݣالو ليه: «فسر لينا المتال ديال الزوان اللي فالفدان!».,"Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, ""Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.""",And that time he left the clothes and came back to the students and started to come together in theater!
وجاوبهم وݣال: «اللي كيزرع الزريعة المزيانة هو ولد الإنسان،,"He answered, ""The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man.","And then he tell them that he serves good veggies, which he is a guy, is a good person."
والفدان هو الدنيا، والݣمح المزيان هو ولاد مملكة الله، والزوان هو ولاد الشيطان،,The field is the world. The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.,"It's life, and the great thing that's what's up with your friends, and kids, it's possible for us!"
والعدو اللي زرع الزوان هو إبليس، والحصاد هو آخر الزمان، والحصادا هم الملايكة.,The enemy who plants them is the devil. The harvest is judgment day. And the workers are angels.,"And the thing that elevated the barbecue is the crime, and the secret is the last day."
وكما كيتجمع الزوان ويتحرق بالعافية، هكا غيوقع فاللخر ديال الزمان:,"""The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on judgment day.","And so many minutes and flashing into flames, so this will happen in the little days:"
غادي يصيفط ولد الإنسان الملايكة دياله، وغادي يجمعو من مملكته ݣاع الأمور اللي كتسبب فالدنوب وݣاع هادوك اللي كيدنبو،,The Son of Man will send out his angels. They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also get rid of all who do evil.,"It will give the guy his wife something, and they will get back all the things that happening in the forest!"
ويرميوهم فزوبية د العافية، راه تم فين غادي يكون البكا وتغزاز السنان.,They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will sob and grind their teeth.,"And they'll bring them in a fire million, it'll be a lot of flavour and a deep crying."
ولكن اللي كيطيعو الله غيضويو بحال الشمس فمملكة باهم. إيوا اللي عنده شي ودنين، يسمع!» المتال ديال الكنز والجوهرة والشبكة,Then God's people will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears should listen. The Stories of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl,"But if they have brain and curtains, they just built their legs in the dad's head."

When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.",And you selled to a man who sold all the happiness and didn't find a guy in the bar.
وكتشبه مملكة السماوات عاوتاني لواحد التاجر كان كيقلب على الجوهر الصافي،,"""Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls.","and it makes you into an old language that's really looking for a black flower, which looks red."
وملي لقا واحد الجوهرة غالية بزاف، مشى باع كل ما كيملك وشراها».,He found one that was very valuable. So he went away and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The Story of the Net,"And he found a very expensive skill, he sold all the things that he lost."

It caught all kinds of fish.","Ouf course and you slap the crazy one, they robbed the fish from the sea, and tired it every kind."
وملي عمرات، خرجوها الصيادا لجنب البحر وݣلسو وبداو كيعزلو، اللي مزيان داروه فالسلل واللي ما صالح لوالو رماوه.,"When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.",and when they ran off the fridge they started hard working at the beach and hurt it.
وهكا غادي يكون فاللخر ديال الزمان: غادي يجيو الملايكة ويعزلو المدنبين من بين اللي متاقيين الله،,This is how it will be on judgment day. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right.,So there's going to be the day of the world: the curtains will come and run out
ويرميو المدنبين فالزوبية د العافية، تم فين غادي يكون البكا وتغزاز السنان». الكنز الجديد والقديم,They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace. There the evil ones will sob and grind their teeth.,"They build the clouds on the fire car, so there's a lot of effects to demolish the field."
وسول يسوع تلامده وݣال: «واش فهمتو هادشي كله؟» وجاوبوه: «إيه!»،,"""Do you understand all these things?"" Jesus asked.  ""Yes,"" they replied.",ask him to call him and say that you understand all of this?
وهو يݣول ليهم: «إيوا راه على هادشي، كل واحد من العلما د الشرع عرف مملكة السماوات، كيشبه لشي مول الدار اللي كيخرج من الكنز دياله كل حاجة جديدة وقديمة». الناصرة ما قبلاتش يسوع,"He said to them, ""Every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones."" A Prophet Without Honor","And he tells them that he didn't want to say anything from his own house, which is like a gift, and everyone looks better for them."
وملي كمل يسوع هاد المتول، مشى من تم.,Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he moved on from there.,"And then he finished to catch this train, he left from home."
ورجع لمدينته الناصرة، كيعلم الناس فديور الصلاة حتى تعجبو وبداو كيسولو: «منين جاته هاد الحكمة وهاد المعجزات؟,"He came to his hometown of Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed.  ""Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?"" they asked.","And he went to his city's city until he recognized it, and they started to make it into purchase when it was relieved?"
واش ماشي هادا هو ولد النجار؟ واش ماشي مه هي اللي سميتها مريم، وخوته هم يعقوب ويوسف وسمعان ويهودا؟,"""Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?","Isn't he the neighbor who is the criminal, is he, and his friends, and her wife, and harira?"
واش ماشي ݣاع خواتاته ساكنين فمدينتنا؟ إيوا منين جاه هادشي كله؟»,"Aren't all his sisters with us? Then where did this man get all these things?""","Isn't all our sisters living in our village, so where did all of this find?"
وما عجبهمش الحال، ولكن يسوع ݣال ليهم: «النبي كيتحترم فكل بلاصة من غير فبلاده، وفوسط عائلته» يوحنا 4‏:44 .,"They were not pleased with him at all.  But Jesus said to them, ""A prophet is not honored in his hometown. He doesn't receive any honor in his own home.""","And they didn't like it, but the bird's respectful for everywhere in his own life, and in his lives."
وما دارش فديك البلاصة بزاف ديال المعجزات حيت ما عندهم إيمان.,He did only a few miracles there because they had no faith.,And they didn't give up in that place for a lot of arabic men because they have pressure.
الفصل ربعطاش الموت ديال يوحنا المعمدان,John the Baptist's Head Is Cut Off,The century of death is dirty
وفداك الوقت، سمع هيرودس الحاكم بخبار يسوع،,"At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.","And attentively, listen to the lawyer's news report, then hearing about comfortable crimes."
وهو يݣول للخداما دياله: «هادا راه يوحنا المعمدان اللي تبعت من الموت، داكشي علاش المعجزات كيتدارو على يديه».,"He said to his attendants, ""This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles.""","And he tells his job that he's a crazy boss of his deadline, so he ends up with his hands."
حيت هيرودس كان قبط يوحنا وكتفه ودخله للحبس على قبل هيروديا مراة خوه فيلبس. لوقا,Herod had arrested John. He had tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.,Because the brief was tired and get him to his wife for the house.

وهادشي علاش حلف حتى يعطيها داكشي اللي طلبات.,So he promised with an oath to give her anything she asked for.,So it's not up to her what she wants.
وحيت وصاتها مها آش تدير، ݣالت لهيرودس: «جيب لي دابا راس يوحنا المعمدان فطبسيل!».,"Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, ""Give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate.""","She tells her mother what to do, and then send her to the sausage, make her a crazy cut!"

So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.,"But crazy, but for the animal's presentation, the guests who said so what she wanted."

وجابوه فواحد الطبسيل وعطاوه للبنت، وداته لمها.,His head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.,"And they brought him in a bottle, and they gave him to her daughter."
وجاو تلامد يوحنا، وهزو الدات دياله ودفنوها، ومن بعد مشاو وخبرو يسوع. يسوع كيوكل خمسالاف واحد,John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand,"And the students came, and they caught it and did and died."
وملي سمع يسوع هاد الأمور، مشى من تم فالفلوكة لواحد الموضع خالي بوحده. وملي عرفو الجماعات د الناس بلي هو غادي لتم، تبعوه من المدون على رجليهم.,Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.,"And he's hearing about these things, and he left the guests on his own and then they knew how he went in the morning."
وملي نزل من الفلوكة شاف جماعة كبيرة ديال الناس، وحن عليهم وشفى المرضى ديالهم.,"When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep concern for them. He healed their sick people.","And he's getting out of the best part of the group, and he showed up with a lot of people and keeps."

""There is nothing here,"" they said. ""It's already getting late. Send the crowds away. They can go and buy some food in the villages.""","And the evening crimes have come up today, and they've told him it's going to be a lot of students to buy for our food in the world."
ولكن يسوع ݣال ليهم: «ما كاين لاش يمشيو، عطيوهم نتم ما ياكلو».,"Jesus replied, ""They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.""","but he told them there's no need to go, they give them what to eat."
وݣالو ليه: «راه ما عندنا هنا غير خمسة د الخبزات وجوج حوتات».,"""We have only five loaves of bread and two fish,"" they answered.",And they told him that we only have five pieces of bread here and two fishes.
وݣال ليهم: «أراوهم لي لهنا!».,"""Bring them here to me,"" he said.","And then they told them, give them here!"
وهو يآمر الجماعات د الناس باش يݣلسو على الربيع. وخدا هادوك الخمسة د الخبزات والجوج د الحوتات وهز عينيه للسما وشكر الله. وملي قطع الخبزات عطى لتلامده، والتلامد عطاو للجماعات ديال الناس.,Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.,And then the administers gave the bread to spill the pieces and then they gave us the living for those little lifts.
وكلاو كلهم حتى شبعو، ومن بعد جمعو طناشر ݣفة عامرة بالطروف د الخبز اللي شاطو.,All of them ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces.,"And they ate all until they brought the floor, and then they tired the bread full of cake."

He had them go on ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.

وملي صيفطهم، طلع للجبل بوحده باش يصلي. وبقى بوحده تم حتى جات العشية.,"After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.","And when he sent them to the prison, he went to the other place to pray until the evening."

وفديك الساعة، تكلم معاهم يسوع وݣال: «تشجعو، أنا هو، ما تخافوش!».,"Right away Jesus called out to them, ""Be brave! It is I. Don't be afraid.""","And at the point, he asked them, and said we couldn't come down, I'm handsome!"

وݣال ليه يسوع: «أجي!» وهو ينزل بطرس من الفلوكة ومشى فوق الما لجهة يسوع.,"""Come,"" Jesus said.  So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.","And he told him to catch the clothes, and he got inside the sea!"
ولكن ملي شاف الريح قوية تخلع وبدا كيغرق، وهو يغوت وݣال: «عتقني آ سيدي!»,"But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, ""Lord! Save me!""","but he saw the strong risk and said he was drawn, sir!"

حيت الله كيݣول: تهلى فباك ومك، واللي سب باه ولا مه خاصه يتقتل.,"God said, 'Honor your father and mother.' (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, 'If anyone calls down a curse on his father or mother, he will be put to death.'

ولكن نتم كتݣولو: اللي ݣال لباه ولا مه: داكشي اللي خاصني نعاونكم بيه راه عطيته هدية لله،,"But you allow people to say to their parents, 'Any help you might have received from us is a gift set apart for God.'","But what you say, then tells you and your granddads, it's a presentation, and then I gave him the mistake."
ما بقاش واجب عليه يتهلى فباه. وهكا لغيتو كلام الله باش تبعو العادة ديالكم.,So they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings.,It's not up to him to help his dad anymore and so god helps us follow your job.

وعيط يسوع على تلامده وݣال ليهم: «بقاو في هاد الناس، علاحقاش تلت يام هادي وهم معاي، وما عندهم ما ياكلو. وما بغيتش نصيفطهم جيعانين باش ما يسخفوش فالطريق».,"Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, ""I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home.""","And I don't want to get hungry from these students for three days, and tell them not to die about it."
وهم يݣولو ليه تلامده: «منين غادي نجيبو فهاد الخلا الخبز اللي يشبع جماعة كبيرة بحال هادي؟»،,"His disciples answered him. ""There is nothing here,"" they said. ""Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?""","And being afraid to say to him that from where we go, we'll get the big bread from this like this?"
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «شحال من خبزة عندكم؟»، وجاوبوه: «سبعة د الخبزات وشي حوتات صغار».,"""How many loaves do you have?"" Jesus asked.  ""Seven,"" they replied, ""and a few small fish.""","And then then they told me how many breads you have, a full of cats, and you made him a small little living."
وآمر يسوع الجماعة د الناس باش يݣلسو للأرض،,Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.,And then call the guests so they can sit down to the forest!
وخدا هادوك سبعة د الخبزات والحوتات، وشكر الله وقطعهم وعطى لتلامده، وتلامده عطاو للجماعات د الناس.,He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people.,"And he took three bread and fish, and thankfully give them to the administratives."
وكلاو كلهم حتى شبعو، وهزو سبعة د الݣفات عامرين بالطروف د الخبز اللي شاطو.,"All of them ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces.","And they ate all until they get full of cats, and they brought the bread cheeks that cheated on the ducks."
وكانو الناس اللي كلاو ربعالاف واحد من غير العيالات والولاد.,"The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.",And the strangers who ate 1 birth of girls except for their children.
وملي صيفط يسوع الجماعات د الناس، ركب فالفلوكة وجا لجوايه بلاد مجدان.,"After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan.","And he sent out the administrations to people, and then then get in the laundry country."
الفصل سطاش علامات الزمان,Jesus Is Asked for a Miraculous Sign,Twenty years like the living.
وجاو لعند يسوع شي وحدين من الفريسيين والصدوقيين باش يجربوه، وطلبو منه يبين ليهم شي علامة من السما. متى,The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.,They came to the team and then they asked for some of the price and the curtains to make them a secret.
ولكن هو جاوبهم وݣال: «ملي كتغرب الشمس كتݣولو: الجو غيكون صافي، علاحقاش السما حمرا.,"He replied, ""In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be good weather. The sky is red.'","But why doesn't he answer them and then since when the sunsets say it's green, it'll be a lot"
وفالصباح بكري كتݣولو: اليوم غادي تكون الشتا، علاحقاش السما حمرا ومضببة. كتعرفو تفسرو حالة الجو، ولكن علامات الزمان ما كتقدروش تفسروهم!,"And in the morning you say, 'Today it will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now.","And at the early evening, but you can't explain the weather, but there's a lot of red and red winters!"
جيل قبيح وفاسد كيطلب علامة، وما غادي تعطاه حتى شي علامة من غير علامة يونان». ومن بعد خلاهم يسوع ومشى. متى 12‏:39؛ لوقا 11‏:29 خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين,"An evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah.""  Then Jesus left them and went away. The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees","And at the end he's crazy, and then he'll give birth to degree and leave a good approach."
وملي وصلو التلامد للجهة لخرى من البحر، نساو ياخدو معاهم الخبز.,The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread.,"And then getting to the other side of the sea, they forgot to take bread."
وݣال ليهم يسوع: «ردو البال، حضيو راسكم من خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين!». لوقا,"""Be careful,"" Jesus said to them. ""Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.""","And then he asked them to be careful, take care of yourself from crocodile stomach and delivery!"
وهم يݣولو مع راسهم: «كيݣول لينا هاد الكلام علاحقاش ما خديناش معانا الخبز».,"The disciples talked about this among themselves. They said, ""He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread.""","And then they think about it, 'What about that bread we didn't get.'"
وعرف يسوع فاش كيفكرو وݣال ليهم: «علاش آ قلالين الإيمان كتݣولو فخاطركم: ما عندنا خبز؟,"Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, ""Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?",And know what do they think about it and tell them why don't you say bread ?
واش مازال ما فهمتو؟ واش ما عقلتوش على خمسة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على خمسالاف واحد، وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو من الطروف د الخبز؟ متى,"Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?","Didn't you understand about 5 bread clothes yet, how much you have cheated on the ducks?"
وما عقلتوش على سبعة د الخبزات اللي تفرقو على ربعالاف واحد وشحال من ݣفة جمعتو؟ متى,"Don't you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?",And you didn't remember three breads that you've left for one long time?
كيفاش ما قدرتوش تفهمو بلي أنا ما كنتش كنقصد بكلامي ليكم الخبز؟ حضيو راسكم من خميرة الفريسيين والصدوقيين!».,"How can you possibly not understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.""",How can't you understand that I don't mean the bread's stuff and the kind of humour.
وديك الساعة، عاد فهمو تلامده بلي ݣال ليهم يحضيو راسهم من تعليم الفريسيين والصدوقيين، ماشي من خميرة الخبز. بطرس كيشهد بلي يسوع هو المسيح,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ,"And then then, then they understand that the sheep wasn't the one who told them to take care of their childhood and delivery."
وملي وصل يسوع لجوايه قيصرية فيلبس، سول تلامده: «شكون هو ولد الإنسان فنضر الناس؟»,"Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, ""Who do people say the Son of Man is?""","and when he came to the surgery afterwards, he asked about his own childhood in the prison with the guests?"
وهم يجاوبوه: «شي منهم كيݣول: يوحنا المعمدان، وشي كيݣول: النبي إيليا، ووحدين خرين كيݣولو: النبي إرميا ولا شي واحد من الأنبيا». متى,"They replied, ""Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.""","And when other people asked about him, some of them said 'cheese', and some crimes'."
وسولهم: «ونتم شكون أنا فنضركم؟».,"""But what about you?"" he asked. ""Who do you say I am?""","And ask them, what about 'me, 'Whom am I ?'!"
وجاوب سمعان بطرس وݣال: «نت هو المسيح ولد الله الحي!»، يوحنا,"Simon Peter answered, ""You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God.""","And then words, you're the last person in the mood!"
وݣال ليه يسوع: «سعداتك آ سمعان بن يونا! علاحقاش ماشي شي بنادم اللي وراك هاد الحقيقة، ولكن با اللي فالسماوات هو اللي وراها ليك.,"Jesus replied, ""Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! No mere man showed this to you. My Father in heaven showed it to you.","And he told him to call you, but thank you dad!"
وأنا راني نݣول ليك: نت بطرس، وعلى هاد الصخرة غادي نبني كنيستي، وقوة الموت ما غتقدرش عليها.,Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.,"And I'll tell you, you two, and you're a piece, and I'm not going to build in this corner with death."
وغنعطيك سوارت مملكة السماوات، كل حاجة غتربطها فالأرض غادي تكون مربوطة فالسماوات، وكل حاجة غتحلها فالأرض غادي تكون محلولة فالسماوات». متى,"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven.""","And I'll give you the keys of black, and you'll have to put it in the stairs, and everything in the back that you will hold in the drawers."
ومن بعد وصى يسوع تلامده باش ما يݣولو لحتى شي حد بلي هو المسيح. يسوع كيتنبأ بالموت والبعت دياله,Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus Tells About His Coming Death,And then he talked to catch his students into cursing anyone else.
ومن ديك الساعة، بدا يسوع كيبين لتلامده بلي خاصه يمشي لأورشليم ويتعدب بزاف على يد الشيوخ والرؤسا د رجال الدين والعلما د الشرع، وخاصه يتقتل، وفاليوم التالت غيتبعت من الموت.,"From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again.","And that's why he's started to criticize, and the rest of the religionist's men need to go into law and be quite imagine."
وجره بطرس للجنب وبدا كيخاصم عليه وكيݣول: «حاشا آ سيدي باش يطرا ليك هادشي!»،,"Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. ""Never, Lord!"" he said. ""This will never happen to you!""","And he robbed it outside and started to laugh at it, sir!"
وهو يتلفت وݣال لبطرس: «بعد مني آ هاد الشيطان! نت راك سباب عترة لي، علاحقاش كتفكر فأمور الناس ماشي فأمور الله».,"Jesus turned and said to Peter, ""Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You do not have in mind the things of God. Instead, you are thinking about human things.""","And then the point is, you don't think about the crime with me, do you?"
وهو يݣول يسوع لتلامده: «إلا بغا شي واحد يتبعني، خاصه يسمح فراسه ويهز الصليب دياله ويتبعني، متى,"Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, ""If anyone wants to follow me, he must say no to himself. He must pick up his cross and follow me.","And he tells that call for example, if someone wants to leave me alone, he should have taken care of him and left me handling him."
علاحقاش اللي بغا ينجي حياته غيضيعها، ولكن اللي ضيع حياته على قبلي غيلقاها. متى,"If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.","While until he wants to leave his life, but then he will find it for me."
آش من نفع عند بنادم إلا ربح الدنيا كلها وضيع حياته؟ ولا آش غادي يعطي بنادم فعوض حياته؟,"""What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses his soul? Or what can anyone trade for his soul?",what wrong with people if he win all his life and his lifes going out?
راه غادي يجي ولد الإنسان مع الملايكة دياله فعز باه وغيجازي كل واحد على حساب الأعمال دياله. متى,The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory. His angels will come with him. And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done.,Then he will come with his wife instead and he will pay for his dad's job.
ونݣول ليكم الحق: راه كاين فالحاضرين هنا اللي ما غيموتو حتى يشوفو ولد الإنسان جاي فمملكته».,"""What I'm about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.""","And I tell you the truth: they are in the aeroports here, they will not see the kid in his own place."
الفصل سبعطاش يسوع كيبان فالعز دياله,Jesus' Appearance Is Changed,Thirst year he looks like his life
ومن بعد ست يام، دا يسوع بطرس ويعقوب وخوه يوحنا، وطلعهم بوحدهم لواحد الجبل عالي.,"After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were all alone.","And then after three days, he take breakfast and his son and his friend to a high mountain."
وتبدل الشكل دياله قدامهم، وضوا وجهه كالشمس، وحوايجه ولاو بويض كيلمعو كالنور.,There in front of them his appearance was changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as the light.,"And she changed his act, and his face was clearly wipeed, and he went whitely in the morning."
وهو يبان ليهم موسى وإيليا كيتكلمو مع يسوع.,Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.,And They seem to be realist and they speak with Mosque.
وݣال بطرس ليسوع: «شحال مزيان نبقاو هنا آ سيدي. إلا بغيتي، نصايب هنا تلاتة د النوايل، وحدة ليك ووحدة لموسى ووحدة لإيليا».,"Peter said to Jesus, ""Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.""","And tell the same fortune, how much would it be to stay here, sir, if you want."
وفالوقت فاش كان كيتكلم ضللات عليهم واحد السحابة مضوية، وتكلم صوت من السحابة وݣال: «هادا هو ولدي العزيز اللي بيه فرحت بزاف، سمعو ليه!». 2بطرس 1‏:17‏،18,"While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud surrounded them. A voice from the cloud said, ""This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!""","And at the time he was very happy, when he talked about his son, he spoiled a curtain voice and attacked the fields with the friends and the birds!"
وملي سمعو التلامد هادشي، طاحو على وجوههم وخافو بزاف.,"When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell with their faces to the ground.","And then hearing of this, they fought off their faces and were jealous."
وقرب يسوع لعندهم ومسهم وݣال ليهم: «نوضو، ما تخافوش!».,"But Jesus came and touched them. ""Get up,"" he said. ""Don't be afraid.""","And he called them and said let's go, don't be shameful!"
وهزو عينيهم وشافو غير يسوع بوحده.,"When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.",And they saw their winds and just leaving alone.
وفالوقت فاش كانو نازلين من الجبل، وصاهم يسوع وݣال: «ما تݣولو لحتى شي حد هادشي اللي شفتو حتى يتبعت ولد الإنسان من الموت».,"They came down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. ""Don't tell anyone what you have seen,"" he said. ""Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.""","And at the timing when they went from the mountain, they asked me to stay up from deadline and told me not to call anyone."
وسولوه تلامده: «إيوا علاش كيݣولو العلما د الشرع بلي فاللول خاص النبي إيليا يجي؟».,"The disciples asked him, ""Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?""",And ask the students why do we have to say what happened on the bird's acceptment?
وجاوبهم وݣال: «فالحقيقة، إيليا غيجي هو اللول وغيصلح كلشي،,"Jesus replied, ""That's right. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again.","And then he said, actually, a criminar will come already first."
ولكن نݣول ليكم: راه جا إيليا وما عرفوهش، ودارو بيه ما بغاو، وهكا ولد الإنسان حتى هو غادي يتعدب على يديهم». متى,"But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People didn't recognize him. They have done to him everything they wanted to do. In the same way, they are going to make the Son of Man suffer.""","But I'll tell you, it's a bad came, and they didn't find them, too, and then they would've gone to know what they want."
وديك الساعة فهمو التلامد بلي كان كيتكلم ليهم على يوحنا المعمدان. يسوع كيشافي ولد مسكون,Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus Heals a Boy Who Had a Demon,And then they understand the points that he was talking to them about his animals.
وملي وصل يسوع والتلامد دياله لعند الجماعة د الناس، جا لعنده واحد الراجل وسجد ليه،,"When they came near the crowd, a man approached Jesus. He got on his knees in front of him.",And since he came to his catch and he got along to a guy and a part of him.

""How long do I have to stay with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.""","And then call them, whenever I'm gonna get the kid, then when I'll stay here, so how much will I get you?"
ونهض يسوع فالجن، وهو يخرج من الولد، وتشافى ديك الساعة.,"Jesus ordered the demon to leave the boy, and it came out of him. He was healed at that very moment.","And the clouds will climb, and the kid will get out of there."
وقربو التلامد ليسوع وسولوه غير بينهم وبينه وݣالو: «علاش ما قدرناش حنا نخرجو الجن؟».,"Then the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, ""Why couldn't we drive out the demon?""",And they went to the players and asked him only about him and then we couldn't go out with him?
وݣال ليهم: «بسباب قلة إيمانكم! ونݣول ليكم الحق: إلا كان عندكم إيمان قد حبة الخردل، غادي تݣولو لهاد الجبل: تحول من هنا لهيه، وغادي يتحول. وحتى شي حاجة ما غتكون محال عندكم. [,"He replied, ""Because your faith is much too small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there.' And it will move.

Then Jesus said to them, ""The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men.","And living on mountains in this little country, and then then saying that the guests would give up to them a lot of people."
وغيقتلوه، وفالنهار التالت غيتبعت». وحزنو التلامد بزاف. يسوع كيخلص الضريبة ديال بيت الله,"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead.""  Then the disciples were filled with deep sadness. Jesus Pays the Temple Tax","And then him, and the next day of the bathroom, then he left the degree for my goal."
وملي رجع يسوع وتلامده لكفرناحوم، جاو مالين الضريبة ديال بيت الله عند بطرس وسولوه: «واش ما كيخلصش المعلم ديالكم الضريبة ديال بيت الله؟».,"Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum. There the tax collectors came to Peter. They asked him, ""Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?""","And when you got back your teacher's money, the goal came back to the guest's room?"
وجاوبهم: «إيه، راه كيخلصها». وملي دخل للدار سبقه يسوع وݣال ليه: «آش بان ليك آ سمعان؟ من عند من كياخدو ملوك الأرض الضريبة ولا الجزية؟ واش من ولادهم ولا من البراني؟».,"""Yes, he does,"" he replied.  When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. ""What do you think, Simon?"" he asked. ""Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and fees from? Do they collect from their own sons or from others?""","And then what do you think about it, and then get the children's payers a pay from the hospital?"
وجاوبه بطرس: «من البراني». وهو يݣول يسوع: «على هادشي ولادهم راهم معفيين من الضريبة.,"""From others,"" Peter answered.  ""Then the sons don't have to pay,"" Jesus said to him.","And then words of then, they're from strangers, and they'll tell them about the pay."
ولكن باش ما نتسببوش ليهم فشي مشكل، سير للبحر ورمي الصنارة، والحوتة اللولى اللي غتشدها، حل ليها فمها، وغادي تلقا فيه ربعة ديال الدراهم، خدها وسير خلص عليك وعلي».,"""But we don't want to make them angry.
