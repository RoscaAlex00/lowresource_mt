الفصل طناش يسوع كيعلم على السبت,Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day,the twelfth chapter is about Saturday

So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"And then, on a Saturday, when Jesus passed through the field of fields, his disciples were hungry, and they started to cut the seeds and eat them."
وملي شافوهم الفريسيين ݣالو ليه: «شوف تلامدك كيديرو شي حوايج ما خاصهمش يتدارو نهار السبت!».,"The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, ""Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath.

Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he entered the house of God, and ate all the bread that was offered to God, which he and those with him were not to eat except the religious leaders."

It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"Have you not read in the Bible that clerics, while working in the temple on Saturdays, are attacking on Saturdays, and that's not a crime?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.",But I tell you: there is here the one who is greater than the house of God.

(Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.","And if you understood the meaning of the verse that says: I want mercy not sacrifice, then everyone should have judged him for what he should not have done."

The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, ""Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?""",A man with a paralyzed hand was found. They asked him and asked him if he could heal on Saturday. They asked him to find a charge.
وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?",He answered them:

It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.","Then he said to the man with the paralyzed hand, 'Stretch out your hand! ' And it was like the other hand."

So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","He knew when they were thinking and said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is ruined, and every city or family divided against itself will not stand."

It has not been given to outsiders.","He answered them and said, 'Because it is given to you to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it is not given to those to understand them."
حيت اللي عنده، غيتعطاه ويتزاد ليه كتر من القياس. واللي ما عندوش، حتى داكشي اللي عنده غادي يتخاد منه. متى,"Everyone who has that kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have very much.

They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.,"But the word of God is not well studied in his heart, and his faith is only brief, and when problems and turbulence arise, he quickly falls away from the faith."
