So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.,"And then, on a Saturday, Jesus went through the garden of the seeds, and his disciples were hungry, and they started to cut the seeds and eat."

ورد عليهم: «واش ما قريتوش آش دار داود ملي جاه الجوع هو وهادوك اللي معاه؟,"Jesus answered, ""Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.","he answered them, 'have you not read what did david and his friends when they were hungry?"

Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he entered the house of God, and all the bread they offered to God, which he and his companions could not eat except the clergy."

It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.,"Have you not read in the Torah that the clergy, who work in the temple on Saturdays, do not practise on Saturdays, so that's not a fault of them?"
ولكن أنا نݣول ليكم: راه كاين هنا اللي هو كبر من بيت الله.,"""I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.","But I tell you, there is greater than this house of God."

(Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean.

وجاوبهم: «إلا شي واحد فيكم عنده خروف واحد وطاح ليه فحفرة نهار السبت، واش ما غيقبطوش ويهزه ويخرجه؟ لوقا,"He said to them, ""What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath?

So he said to them, ""Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.","Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, ""Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city divided against itself and every family divided against themselves will not endure."

Then how can his kingdom stand?","If the devil cast out the devil, then the devil will split himself up against himself, and if he split up against himself, how will his kingdom stand?"

In fact, they will have very much. If anyone doesn't have that kind of knowledge, even what little he has will be taken away from him.","Because he has, he will give it and it will increase his weight. And who doesn't have, even what he has, he will take from him. When?"
وأنا كنتكلم معاهم بالمتول علاحقاش ملي كيشوفو ما كيشوفوش، وملي كيسمعو ما كيسمعوش وما كيفهموش.,"Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people. I say, ""They look, but they don't really see.  They listen, but they don't really hear or understand.","I speak to them with a lot of respect, because they see nothing, they hear nothing, they don't understand nothing."

«إيوا سمعو نتم المعنى د المتال ديال الراجل اللي كيزرع:,"""Listen! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer.",the meaning of the man who grows
اللي كيسمع الكلام ديال مملكة الله وما كيفهموش، كيجي الشيطان وكيخطف داكشي اللي تزرع فقلبه، وهادا هو اللي كنشبهه بالزرع اللي طاح فالطريق.,People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path.,"He who hears the Kingdom talk and doesn't understand, the devil comes and takes what's planted in his heart, and he's like the seed that fell in the road."
واللي تزرع فالأرض المحجرة، هادا هو اللي كيسمع كلام الله وكيقبله دغيا بالفرحة،,Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.,"And he who sows in the pebble, he is he who hears the word of God and welcomes it with joy,"

They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.,"But the word of God is not very good in his heart, his faith is short, and those who are troubled and angry, he quickly turn away from the faith."

They are those who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep it from producing fruit.,"The one who is sown among thorns is the one who hears the word of God but is worldly and money-loving, so that the word of God is not in him and it is not fruitful."

He said, ""The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed.
