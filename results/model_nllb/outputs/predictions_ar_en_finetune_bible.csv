Only priests were allowed to eat it.,"And how he entered the house of God, and the bread they offered to God, which he had no right to eat, not him or his companions, but the religious men alone."

It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.","Then Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, ""Stretch out your hand! Turn it on, and it will be as good as the other one."

They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.,"But the word of God is not well kept in his heart, and his faith is short, and when problems and abuse arise, he quickly falls short of faith."
