 The Family Line of Jesus   
 This is a record of the family line of Jesus Christ. He is the son of David. He is also the son of Abraham.   
 Abraham was the father of Isaac.  Isaac was the father of Jacob.  Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.   
 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah. Tamar was their mother.  Perez was the father of Hezron.  Hezron was the father of Ram.   
 Ram was the father of Amminadab.  Amminadab was the father of Nahshon.  Nahshon was the father of Salmon.   
 Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was Boaz's mother.  Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was Obed's mother.  Obed was the father of Jesse.   
 And Jesse was the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon. Solomon's mother had been Uriah's wife.   
 Solomon was the father of Rehoboam.  Rehoboam was the father of Abijah.  Abijah was the father of Asa.   
 Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat.  Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram.  Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.   
 Uzziah was the father of Jotham.  Jotham was the father of Ahaz.  Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.   
 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh.  Manasseh was the father of Amon.  Amon was the father of Josiah.   
 And Josiah was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon.   
 After this, the family line continued.  Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel.  Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.   
 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.  Abiud was the father of Eliakim.  Eliakim was the father of Azor.   
 Azor was the father of Zadok.  Zadok was the father of Akim.  Akim was the father of Eliud.   
 Eliud was the father of Eleazar.  Eleazar was the father of Matthan.  Matthan was the father of Jacob.   
 Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called Christ.   
 So there were 14 generations from Abraham to David. There were 14 from David until the Jewish people were forced to go away to Babylon. And there were 14 from that time to the Christ. Jesus Christ Is Born   
 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. His mother Mary and Joseph had promised to get married. But before they started to live together, it became clear that she was going to have a baby. She became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
 Her husband Joseph was a godly man. He did not want to put her to shame in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly.   
 But as Joseph was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary home as your wife. The baby inside her is from the Holy Spirit.  
 She is going to have a son. You must give him the name Jesus. That is because he will save his people from their sins."   
 All of this took place to bring about what the Lord had said would happen. He had said through the prophet,  
 "The virgin is going to have a baby. She will give birth to a son. And he will be called Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."   
 Joseph woke up. He did what the angel of the Lord commanded him to do. He took Mary home as his wife.  
 But he did not make love to her until after she gave birth to a son. And Joseph gave him the name Jesus. 
 The Wise Men Visit Jesus   
 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea.  After Jesus' birth, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem.  
 They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."   
 When King Herod heard about it, he was very upset. Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too.  
 So Herod called together all the chief priests of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Christ was going to be born.   
 "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied. "This is what the prophet has written. He said,   
 " 'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,  are certainly not the least important among the towns of Judah.  A ruler will come out of you.  He will be the shepherd of my people Israel.' " (Micah 5:2)   
 Then Herod called for the Wise Men secretly. He found out from them exactly when the star had appeared.  
 He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I can go and worship him too."   
 After the Wise Men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was.  
 When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.   
 The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, incense and myrrh.   
 But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country on a different road. Jesus' Family Escapes to Egypt   
 When the Wise Men had left, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to come back. Herod is going to search for the child. He wants to kill him."   
 Joseph got up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.  
 They stayed there until King Herod died. So the words the Lord had spoken through the prophet came true. He had said, "I chose to bring my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)   
 Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him. So he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the area around it. All the boys two years old and under were to be killed. This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star.   
 In this way, the words the prophet Jeremiah spoke came true. He had said,   
 "A voice is heard in Ramah.  It's the sound of crying and deep sadness.  Rachel is crying over her children.  She refuses to be comforted,  because they are gone." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' Family Returns to Nazareth   
 After Herod died, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him.  
 The angel said, "Get up! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."   
 So Joseph got up. He took the child and his mother Mary back to the land of Israel.  
 But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there.  Warned in a dream, Joseph went back to the land of Galilee instead.  
 There he lived in a town called Nazareth. So what the prophets had said about Jesus came true. They had said, "He will be called a Nazarene." 
 John the Baptist Prepares the Way   
 In those days John the Baptist came and preached in the Desert of Judea.  
 He said, "Turn away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."   
 John is the one the prophet Isaiah had spoken about. He had said, "A messenger is calling out in the desert,  'Prepare the way for the Lord.  Make straight paths for him.' " (Isaiah 40:3)   
 John's clothes were made out of camel's hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.  
 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all of Judea. They also came from the whole area around the Jordan River.  
 When they admitted they had sinned, John baptized them in the Jordan.   
 John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You are like a nest of poisonous snakes! Who warned you to escape the coming of God's anger?  
 Produce fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins.  
 Don't think you can say to yourselves, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham even from these stones.  
 The ax is already lying at the roots of the trees. All the trees that don't produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.   
 "I baptize you with water, calling you to turn away from your sins. But after me, one will come who is more powerful than I am. And I'm not fit to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  
 His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the storeroom. But he will burn up the husks with fire that can't be put out." Jesus Is Baptized   
 Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.  
 But John tried to stop him. He told Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. So why do you come to me?"   
 Jesus replied, "Let it be this way for now. It is right for us to do this. It carries out God's holy plan." Then John agreed.   
 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God coming down on him like a dove.   
 A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him." 
 Jesus Is Tempted   
 The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There the devil tempted him.  
 After 40 days and 40 nights of going without eating, Jesus was hungry.   
 The tempter came to him. He said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."   
 Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man doesn't live only on bread. He also lives on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)   
 Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple.  
 "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. It is written, " 'The Lord will command his angels to take good care of you.  They will lift you up in their hands.  Then you won't trip over a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11,12)   
 Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.' " (Deuteronomy 6:16)   
 Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.  
 "If you bow down and worship me," he said, "I will give you all of this."   
 Jesus said to him, "Get away from me, Satan! It is written, 'Worship the Lord your God. He is the only one you should serve.' " (Deuteronomy 6:13)   
 Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him. Jesus Begins to Preach   
 John had been put in prison. When Jesus heard about this, he returned to Galilee.   
 Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the city of Capernaum. It was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali.  
 In that way, what the prophet Isaiah had said came true. He had said,   
 "Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali!  Galilee, where non-Jewish people live!  Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Territory east of the Jordan River!   
 The people who are now living in darkness  will see a great light.  They are now living in a very dark land.  But a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)   
 From that time on Jesus began to preach. "Turn away from your sins!" he said. "The kingdom of heaven is near." Jesus Chooses the First Disciples   
 One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake. They were fishermen.  
 "Come. Follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of people."   
 At once they left their nets and followed him.   
 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers. They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee. As they were preparing their nets, Jesus called out to them.   
 Right away they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus Heals Sick People   
 Jesus went all over Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues. He preached the good news of God's kingdom. He healed every illness and sickness the people had.   
 News about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were ill with different kinds of sicknesses. Some were suffering great pain. Others were controlled by demons. Some were shaking wildly. Others couldn't move at all. And Jesus healed all of them.   
 Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the area known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the area across the Jordan River. 
 Jesus Gives Blessings   
 Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him.  
 Then he began to teach them.  He said,   
 "Blessed are those who are spiritually needy.  The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.   
 Blessed are those who are sad.  They will be comforted.   
 Blessed are those who are free of pride.  They will be given the earth.   
 Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for what is right.  They will be filled.   
 Blessed are those who show mercy.  They will be shown mercy.   
 Blessed are those whose hearts are pure.  They will see God.   
 Blessed are those who make peace.  They will be called sons of God.   
 Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right.  The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.   
 "Blessed are you when people make fun of you and hurt you because of me. You are also blessed when they tell all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.  
 Be joyful and glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people hurt the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and Light   
 "You are the salt of the earth. But suppose the salt loses its saltiness. How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk all over it.   
 "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill can't be hidden.  
 Also, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then it gives light to everyone in the house.   
 "In the same way, let your light shine in front of others. Then they will see the good things you do. And they will praise your Father who is in heaven. Jesus Gives Full Meaning to the Law   
 "Do not think I have come to get rid of what is written in the Law or in the Prophets. I have not come to do that. Instead, I have come to give full meaning to what is written.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter disappears from the Law. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is completed.   
 "Do not break even one of the least important commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.   
 "Here is what I tell you. You must be more godly than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder   
 "You have heard what was said to people who lived long ago. They were told, 'Do not commit murder. (Exodus 20:13) Anyone who murders will be judged for it.'  
 But here is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be judged. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' must stand trial in the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire in hell.   
 "Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar. And you remember that your brother has something against you.  
 Leave your gift in front of the altar. First go and make peace with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.   
 "Suppose someone has a claim against you and is taking you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still with him on your way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. You will not get out until you have paid the very last penny! Adultery   
 "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)  
 But here is what I tell you. Do not even look at a woman in the wrong way. Anyone who does has already committed adultery with her in his heart.   
 "If your right eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. Your eye is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.   
 "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than for your whole body to go into hell. Divorce   
 "It has been said, 'Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he does, he must give her a letter of divorce.' (Deuteronomy 24:1)  
 But here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who gets married to the divorced woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him. Oaths   
 "Again, you have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, 'Do not break the promises you make to the Lord. Keep the oaths you have made to him.'  
 But here is what I tell you. Do not make any promises like that at all. Do not make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.  
 Do not make them in the name of the earth. That is the stool for God's feet. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the Great King.  
 And do not take an oath in the name of your head. You can't make even one hair white or black.   
 "Just let your 'Yes' mean 'Yes.' Let your 'No' mean 'No.' Anything more than this comes from the evil one. Be Kind to Others   
 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye must be put out for an eye. A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth.' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)  
 But here is what I tell you. Do not fight against an evil person.  "Suppose someone hits you on your right cheek. Turn your other cheek to him also.  
 Suppose someone takes you to court to get your shirt. Let him have your coat also.  
 Suppose someone forces you to go one mile. Go two miles with him.   
 "Give to the one who asks you for something. Don't turn away from the one who wants to borrow something from you. Love Your Enemies   
 "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor. (Leviticus 19:18) Hate your enemy.'  
 But here is what I tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.  
 Then you will be sons of your Father who is in heaven.  "He causes his sun to shine on evil people and good people. He sends rain on those who do right and those who don't.   
 "If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even the tax collectors do that.  
 If you greet only your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even people who are ungodly do that.  
 So be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. 
 Giving to Needy People   
 "Be careful not to do 'good works' in front of others. Don't do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.   
 "When you give to needy people, do not announce it by having trumpets blown. Do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They announce what they do in the synagogues and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I'm about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward.   
 "When you give to the needy, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.  
 Then your giving will be done secretly. Your Father will reward you. He sees what you do secretly. Prayer   
 "When you pray, do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners. They want to be seen by others. What I'm about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward.   
 "When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who can't be seen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done secretly.   
 "When you pray, do not keep talking on and on the way ungodly people do. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot.  
 Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.   
 "This is how you should pray. " 'Our Father in heaven,  may your name be honored.   
 May your kingdom come.  May what you want to happen be done  on earth as it is done in heaven.   
 Give us today our daily bread.   
 Forgive us our sins,  just as we also have forgiven those who sin against us.   
 Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted.  Save us from the evil one.'   
 "Forgive people when they sin against you. If you do, your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you.  
 But if you do not forgive people their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Fasting   
 "When you go without eating, do not look gloomy like those who only pretend to be holy. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people they are fasting. What I'm about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward.   
 "But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.  
 Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who can't be seen, will know it. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done secretly. Put Away Riches in Heaven   
 "Do not put away riches for yourselves on earth. Moths and rust can destroy them. Thieves can break in and steal them.  
 Instead, put away riches for yourselves in heaven. There, moths and rust do not destroy them. There, thieves do not break in and steal them.  
 Your heart will be where your riches are.   
 "The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.  
 But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light inside you is darkness, then it is very dark!   
 "No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one of them and love the other. Or he will be faithful to one and dislike the other. You can't serve God and Money at the same time. Do Not Worry   
 "I tell you, do not worry. Don't worry about your life and what you will eat or drink. And don't worry about your body and what you will wear. Isn't there more to life than eating? Aren't there more important things for the body than clothes?   
 "Look at the birds of the air. They don't plant or gather crops. They don't put away crops in storerooms. But your Father who is in heaven feeds them. Aren't you worth much more than they are?   
 "Can you add even one hour to your life by worrying?   
 "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or make clothing.  
 But here is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all of his glory was dressed like one of those flowers.   
 "If that is how God dresses the wild grass, won't he dress you even better? After all, the grass is here only today. Tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. Your faith is so small!   
 "So don't worry. Don't say, 'What will we eat?' Or, 'What will we drink?' Or, 'What will we wear?'  
 People who are ungodly run after all of those things. Your Father who is in heaven knows that you need them.   
 "But put God's kingdom first. Do what he wants you to do. Then all of those things will also be given to you.   
 "So don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. 
 Be Fair When You Judge Others   
 "Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.  
 You will be judged in the same way you judge others. You will be measured in the same way you measure others.   
 "You look at the bit of sawdust in your friend's eye. But you pay no attention to the piece of wood in your own eye.  
 How can you say to your friend, 'Let me take the bit of sawdust out of your eye'? How can you say this while there is a piece of wood in your own eye?   
 "You pretender! First take the piece of wood out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to take the bit of sawdust out of your friend's eye.   
 "Do not give holy things to dogs. Do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they might walk all over them. Then they might turn around and tear you to pieces. Ask, Search, Knock   
 "Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.  
 Everyone who asks will receive. He who searches will find. The door will be opened to the one who knocks.   
 "Suppose your son asks for bread. Which of you will give him a stone?  
 Or suppose he asks for a fish. Which of you will give him a snake?  
 Even though you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!   
 "In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and in the Prophets. The Large and Small Gates   
 "Enter God's kingdom through the narrow gate. The gate is large and the road is wide that lead to death and hell. Many people go that way.  
 But the gate is small and the road is narrow that lead to life. Only a few people find it. A Tree and Its Fruit   
 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But on the inside they are hungry wolves.  
 You can tell what they really are by what they do.  "Do people pick grapes from bushes? Do they pick figs from thorns?  
 In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit. But a bad tree bears bad fruit.  
 A good tree can't bear bad fruit. And a bad tree can't bear good fruit.  
 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down. It is thrown into the fire.  
 You can tell each tree by its fruit.   
 "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants will enter.   
 "Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Didn't we prophesy in your name? Didn't we drive out demons in your name? Didn't we do many miracles in your name?'  
 Then I will tell them clearly, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who do evil!' The Wise and Foolish Builders   
 "So then, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock.  
 The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.   
 "But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man. He builds his house on sand.  
 The rain comes down. The water rises. The winds blow and beat against that house. And it falls with a loud crash."   
 Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.  
 He taught like one who had authority. He did not speak like their teachers of the law. 
 Jesus Heals a Man Who Had a Skin Disease   
 Jesus came down from the mountainside. Large crowds followed him.   
 A man who had a skin disease came and got down on his knees in front of Jesus. He said, "Lord, if you are willing to make me 'clean,' you can do it."   
 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be 'clean'!"  Right away the man was healed of his skin disease.   
 Then Jesus said to him, "Don't tell anyone. Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the gift Moses commanded. It will be a witness to them." A Roman Commander Has Faith   
 When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman commander came to him. He asked Jesus for help.  
 "Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home and can't move. He is suffering terribly."   
 Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."   
 The commander replied, "Lord, I am not good enough to have you come into my house. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.  
 I myself am a man under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."   
 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those following him, "What I'm about to tell you is true. In Israel I have not found anyone whose faith is so strong.   
 "I say to you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  
 But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There they will sob and grind their teeth."   
 Then Jesus said to the Roman commander, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would."  And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus Heals Many People   
 When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was lying in bed. She had a fever.   
 Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.   
 When evening came, many people controlled by demons were brought to Jesus. He drove out the spirits with a word. He healed all who were sick.   
 He did it to make what the prophet Isaiah had said come true. He had said, "He suffered the things we should have suffered.  He took on himself the sicknesses that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) It Costs to Follow Jesus   
 Jesus saw the crowd around him. So he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.   
 Then a teacher of the law came to him. He said, "Teacher, I will follow you no matter where you go."   
 Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes. Birds of the air have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."   
 Another follower said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."   
 But Jesus told him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus Calms the Storm   
 Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.  
 Suddenly a terrible storm came up on the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.   
 The disciples went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We're going to drown!"   
 He replied, "Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?"  Then Jesus got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop. It became completely calm.   
 The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus Heals Two Men Controlled by Demons   
 Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarenes. Two men controlled by demons met him. They came from the tombs. The men were so wild that no one could pass that way.   
 "Son of God, what do you want with us?" they shouted. "Have you come here to punish us before the time for us to be judged?"   
 Not very far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.  
 The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."   
 Jesus said to them, "Go!"  So the demons came out of the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank. They ran into the lake and drowned in the water.   
 Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They went into the town and reported all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons.   
 Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their area. 
 Jesus Heals a Man Who Could Not Walk   
 Jesus stepped into a boat. He went over to the other side of the lake and came to his own town.  
 Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he said to the man, "Don't lose hope, son. Your sins are forgiven."   
 Then some teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is saying a very evil thing!"   
 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?  
 Is it easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven'? Or to say, 'Get up and walk'?  
 I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."  Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home."  
 The man got up and went home.   
 When the crowd saw this, they were filled with wonder. They praised God for giving that kind of authority to men. Jesus Chooses Matthew   
 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew. He was sitting at the tax collector's booth.  "Follow me," Jesus told him. Matthew got up and followed him.   
 Later Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.   
 The Pharisees saw this. So they asked the disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"   
 Jesus heard that. So he said, "Those who are healthy don't need a doctor. Sick people do.  
 Go and learn what this means, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I have not come to get those who think they are right with God to follow me. I have come to get sinners to follow me." Jesus Is Asked About Fasting   
 One day John's disciples came. They said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees go without eating. Why don't your disciples go without eating?"   
 Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the groom be sad while he is with them? The time will come when the groom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.   
 "People don't sew a patch of new cloth on old clothes. The new piece will pull away from the old. That will make the tear worse.   
 "People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, everyone pours new wine into new wineskins. Then both are saved." A Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman   
 While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came. He got down on his knees in front of Jesus. He said, "My daughter has just died. But come and place your hand on her. Then she will live again."   
 Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.   
 Just then a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a sickness that made her bleed. It had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.  
 She thought, "I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."   
 Jesus turned and saw her. "Dear woman, don't give up hope," he said. "Your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that very moment.   
 When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.  
 He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.   
 After the crowd had been sent outside, Jesus went in. He took the girl by the hand, and she got up.  
 News about what Jesus had done spread all over that area. Jesus Heals Two Blind Men   
 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him. They called out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"   
 When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?"  "Yes, Lord," they replied.   
 Then he touched their eyes. He said, "It will happen to you just as you believed."  
 They could now see again. Jesus strongly warned them, "Be sure that no one knows about this."  
 But they went out and spread the news. They talked about him all over that area.   
 While they were going out, another man was brought to Jesus. A demon controlled him, and he could not speak.  
 When the demon was driven out, the man spoke.  The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."  
 But the Pharisees said, "He drives out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There Are Only a Few Workers   
 Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every illness and sickness.  
 When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were beaten down and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.   
 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is huge. But there are only a few workers.  
 So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest field." 
 Jesus Sends Out the Twelve Disciples   
 Jesus called for his 12 disciples to come to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every illness and sickness.   
 Here are the names of the 12 apostles. First are Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then come James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.  
 Next are Philip and Bartholomew, and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two more are James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.  
 The last are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who was later going to hand Jesus over to his enemies.   
 Jesus sent these 12 out with the following orders. "Do not go among those who aren't Jews," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans.  
 Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have become lost.  
 As you go, preach this message, 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'  
 Heal those who are sick. Bring those who are dead back to life. Make those who have skin diseases 'clean' again. Drive out demons. You have received freely, so give freely.   
 "Do not take along any gold, silver or copper in your belts.  
 Do not take a bag for the journey. Do not take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. A worker should be given what he needs.   
 "When you enter a town or village, look for someone who is willing to welcome you. Stay at that person's house until you leave.  
 As you enter the home, greet those who live there.  
 If that home welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. If it does not, don't bless it.   
 "Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.   
 "I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as wise as snakes and as harmless as doves.   
 "Watch out! Men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their synagogues.  
 You will be brought to governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to those who aren't Jews.   
 "But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say.  
 It will not be you speaking. The Spirit of your Father will be speaking through you.   
 "Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and have them put to death.  
 Everyone will hate you because of me. But anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved.   
 "When people attack you in one place, escape to another. What I'm about to tell you is true. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.   
 "A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.  
 It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, what can the others who live there expect?   
 "So don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is secret will be brought out into the open. Everything that is hidden will be uncovered.  
 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.  
 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can't kill the soul. Instead, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.   
 "Aren't two sparrows sold for only a penny? But not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing it.  
 He even counts every hair on your head!  
 So don't be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.   
 "What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I know him.  
 But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I don't know him.   
 "Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.  
 I have come to turn " 'sons against their fathers.  Daughters will refuse to obey their mothers.  Daughters-in-law will be against their mothers-in-law.   
 A man's enemies will be the members of his own family.' (Micah 7:6)   
 "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  
 And anyone who does not pick up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.  
 If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. If anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.   
 "Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me. And anyone who welcomes me welcomes the One who sent me.  
 Suppose someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That one will receive a prophet's reward. And suppose someone welcomes a godly person as a godly person. That one will receive a godly person's reward.  
 Suppose someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little one who follows me. What I'm about to tell you is true. That one will certainly be rewarded." 
 Jesus and John the Baptist   
 Jesus finished teaching his 12 disciples. Then he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.   
 John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.  
 They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"   
 Jesus replied, "Go back to John. Report to him what you hear and see.  
 Blind people receive sight. Disabled people walk. Those who have skin diseases are healed. Deaf people hear. Those who are dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to those who are poor.  
 Blessed are those who do not give up their faith because of me."   
 As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the desert to see? Tall grass waving in the wind?  
 If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.  
 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.  
 He is the one written about in Scripture. It says, " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you.  He will prepare your way for you.' (Malachi 3:1)   
 "What I'm about to tell you is true. No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than he is.  
 Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with force. And forceful people are taking hold of it.  
 All the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John came.  
 If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come.  
 Those who have ears should listen.   
 "What can I compare today's people to? They are like children sitting in the market places and calling out to others. They say,   
 " 'We played the flute for you.  But you didn't dance.  We sang a funeral song.  But you didn't become sad.'  
 When John came, he didn't eat or drink as you do. And people say, 'He has a demon.'  
 But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank as you do. And people say, 'This fellow is always eating and drinking far too much. He's a friend of tax collectors and "sinners." ' Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right." Cities That Do Not Turn Away From Sin   
 Jesus began to speak against the cities where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not turned away from their sins. So he said,  
 "How terrible it will be for you, Korazin! How terrible for you, Bethsaida! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon. They would have turned away from their sins long ago. They would have put on black clothes. They would have sat down in ashes.  
 But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you.   
 "And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted up to heaven? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom. It would still be here today.  
 But I tell you this. On judgment day it will be easier for Sodom than for you." Rest for All Who Are Tired   
 At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father. You are Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and educated. But you have shown them to little children.  
 Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.   
 "My Father has given all things to me. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known.   
 "Come to me, all of you who are tired and are carrying heavy loads. I will give you rest.  
 Become my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and free of pride. You will find rest for your souls.  
 Serving me is easy, and my load is light." 
 Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath Day   
 One Sabbath day Jesus walked through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry. So they began to break off some heads of grain and eat them.  
 The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the Law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"   
 Jesus answered, "Haven't you read about what David did? He and his men were hungry.  
 So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the holy bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.  
 Haven't you read the Law? It tells how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple have to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.   
 "I tell you that one who is more important than the temple is here.  
 Scripture says, 'I want mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what those words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are not guilty.  
 The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath day."   
 Going on from that place, Jesus went into their synagogue.  
 A man with a weak and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, "Does the Law allow us to heal on the Sabbath day?"   
 He said to them, "What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?  
 A man is worth more than sheep! So the Law allows us to do good on the Sabbath day."   
 Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.  
 But the Pharisees went out and planned how to kill Jesus. God's Chosen Servant   
 Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick people.  
 But he warned them not to tell who he was.  
 This was to make what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah come true. It says,   
 "Here is my servant. I have chosen him.  He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him.  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will announce to the nations that everything will be made right.   
 He will not argue or cry out.  No one will hear his voice in the streets.   
 He will not break a bent twig.  He will not put out a dimly burning flame.  He will make everything right.   
 The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebub   
 A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.  
 All the people were amazed. They said, "Could this be the Son of David?"   
 The Pharisees heard this. So they said, "This fellow drives out demons by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons."   
 Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Every kingdom that fights against itself will be destroyed. Every city or family that is divided against itself will not stand.  
 If Satan drives out Satan, he fights against himself. Then how can his kingdom stand?  
 You say I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub. Then by whose power do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.  
 But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then God's kingdom has come to you.   
 "Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and just take what the man owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.   
 "Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not gather sheep with me scatters them.  
 So here is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.  
 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. A person like that won't be forgiven either now or in days to come.   
 "If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.   
 "You nest of poisonous snakes! How can you who are evil say anything good? Your mouths say everything that is in your hearts.  
 A good man says good things. These come from the good that is put away inside him. An evil man says evil things. These come from the evil that is put away inside him.  
 But here is what I tell you. On judgment day, people will have to account for every careless word they have spoken.  
 By your words you will be found guilty or not guilty." The Miraculous Sign of Jonah   
 Some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."   
 He answered, "Evil and unfaithful people ask for a miraculous sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.  
 Jonah was in the stomach of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.   
 "The men of Nineveh will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And the Ninevites will prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned away from their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now one who is more important than Jonah is here.   
 "The Queen of the South will stand up on judgment day with the people now living. And she will prove that they are guilty. She came from very far away to listen to Solomon's wisdom. And now one who is more important than Solomon is here.   
 "What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It goes through dry areas looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find it.  
 Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives there, it finds the house empty. The house has been swept clean and put in order.  
 Then the evil spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They go in and live there. That man is worse off than before. That is how it will be with the evil people of today." Jesus' Mother and Brothers   
 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside. They wanted to speak to him.  
 Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."   
 Jesus replied to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"  
 Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!  
 Anyone who does what my Father in heaven wants is my brother or sister or mother." 
 The Story of the Farmer   
 That same day Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.  
 Large crowds gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat down in it. All the people stood on the shore.  
 Then he told them many things by using stories.  He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seed.  
 He scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on a path. Birds came and ate it up.  
 Some seed fell on rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants came up quickly, because the soil wasn't deep.  
 When the sun came up, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots.  
 Other seed fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and crowded out the plants.  
 Still other seed fell on good soil. It produced a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than what was planted.  
 Those who have ears should listen."   
 The disciples came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you speak to the people?"   
 He replied, "You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to outsiders.  
 Everyone who has that kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have very much. If anyone doesn't have that kind of knowledge, even what little he has will be taken away from him.  
 Here is why I use stories when I speak to the people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see.  They listen, but they don't really hear or understand.   
 "In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true. He said, " 'You will hear but never understand.  You will see but never know what you are seeing.   
 The hearts of these people have become stubborn.  They can barely hear with their ears.  They have closed their eyes.  Otherwise they might see with their eyes.  They might hear with their ears.  They might understand with their hearts.  They might turn to the Lord, and then he would heal them.' (Isaiah 6:9,10)   
 "But blessed are your eyes because they see. And blessed are your ears because they hear.  
 What I'm about to tell you is true. Many prophets and godly people wanted to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.   
 "Listen! Here is the meaning of the story of the farmer.  
 People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was planted in their hearts. Those people are like the seed planted on a path.  
 Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.  
 But they have no roots. So they last only a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or suffering comes because of the message.  
 Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are those who hear the message. But then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep it from producing fruit.  
 But still others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are those who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60 or 30 times more than the farmer planted." The Story of the Weeds   
 Jesus told the crowd another story. "Here is what the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man planted good seed in his field.  
 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away.  
 The wheat began to grow and form grain. At the same time, weeds appeared.   
 "The owner's servants came to him. They said, 'Sir, didn't you plant good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?'   
 " 'An enemy did this,' he replied.  "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull the weeds up?'   
 " 'No,' the owner answered. 'While you are pulling up the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them.  
 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. Here is what I will say to them. First collect the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it into my storeroom.' " The Stories of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast   
 Jesus told the crowd another story. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field.  
 It is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches."   
 Jesus told them still another story. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way all through the dough."   
 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd by using stories. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.  
 So the words spoken by the prophet came true. He had said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories.  I will speak about things that were hidden since the world was made." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus Explains the Story of the Weeds   
 Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Explain to us the story of the weeds in the field."   
 He answered, "The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man.  
 The field is the world. The good seed stands for the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.  
 The enemy who plants them is the devil. The harvest is judgment day. And the workers are angels.   
 "The weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on judgment day.  
 The Son of Man will send out his angels. They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also get rid of all who do evil.  
 They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will sob and grind their teeth.  
 Then God's people will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears should listen. The Stories of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl   
 "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure that was hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.   
 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a trader who was looking for fine pearls.  
 He found one that was very valuable. So he went away and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The Story of the Net   
 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was let down into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.  
 When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.  
 This is how it will be on judgment day. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did what is wrong from those who did what is right.  
 They will throw the evil people into the blazing furnace. There the evil ones will sob and grind their teeth.   
 "Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked.  "Yes," they replied.   
 He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been taught about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house. He brings new treasures out of his storeroom as well as old ones." A Prophet Without Honor   
 Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he moved on from there.  
 He came to his hometown of Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed.  "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.  
 "Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?  
 Aren't all his sisters with us? Then where did this man get all these things?"  
 They were not pleased with him at all.  But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not honored in his hometown. He doesn't receive any honor in his own home."   
 He did only a few miracles there because they had no faith. 
 John the Baptist's Head Is Cut Off   
 At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.  
 He said to his attendants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."   
 Herod had arrested John. He had tied him up and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.  
 John had been saying to Herod, "It is against the Law for you to have her."  
 Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they thought John was a prophet.   
 On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod very much.  
 So he promised with an oath to give her anything she asked for.  
 Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a big plate."   
 The king was very upset. But he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.  
 Herod had John's head cut off in the prison.  
 His head was brought in on a big plate and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.   
 John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand   
 Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.  
 When Jesus came ashore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep concern for them. He healed their sick people.   
 When it was almost evening, the disciples came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "It's already getting late. Send the crowds away. They can go and buy some food in the villages."   
 Jesus replied, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."   
 "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.   
 "Bring them here to me," he said.  
 Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.   
 All of them ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up 12 baskets of leftover pieces.  
 The number of men who ate was about 5,000. Women and children also ate. Jesus Walks on the Water   
 Right away Jesus made the disciples get into the boat. He had them go on ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he sent the crowd away.  
 After he had sent them away, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.  
 The boat was already a long way from land. It was being pounded by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.   
 Early in the morning, Jesus went out to the disciples. He walked on the lake.  
 They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they cried out in fear.   
 Right away Jesus called out to them, "Be brave! It is I. Don't be afraid."   
 "Lord, is it you?" Peter asked. "If it is, tell me to come to you on the water."   
 "Come," Jesus said.  So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water toward Jesus.  
 But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord! Save me!"   
 Right away Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "Your faith is so small!" he said. "Why did you doubt me?"   
 When they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.  
 Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, "You really are the Son of God!"   
 They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret.  
 The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message all over the nearby countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.  
 They begged him to let those who were sick just touch the edge of his clothes. And all who touched him were healed. 
 What Makes People "Unclean"?   
 Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,  
 "Why don't your disciples obey what the elders teach? Your disciples don't wash their hands before they eat!"   
 Jesus replied, "And why don't you obey God's command? You would rather follow your own teachings!  
 God said, 'Honor your father and mother.' (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, 'If anyone calls down a curse on his father or mother, he will be put to death.' (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)  
 But you allow people to say to their parents, 'Any help you might have received from us is a gift set apart for God.'  
 So they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God useless in order to follow your own teachings.   
 "You pretenders! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,   
 " 'These people honor me by what they say.  But their hearts are far away from me.   
 Their worship doesn't mean anything to me.  They teach nothing but human rules.' " (Isaiah 29:13)   
 Jesus called the crowd to him. He said, "Listen and understand.  
 What goes into your mouth does not make you 'unclean.' It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you 'unclean.' "   
 Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?"   
 Jesus replied, "There are plants that my Father in heaven has not planted. They will be pulled up by the roots.  
 Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind person leads another who is blind, both of them will fall into a pit."   
 Peter said, "Explain this to us."   
 "Don't you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.  
 "Don't you see? Everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it goes out of the body.  
 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. Those are the things that make you 'unclean.'  
 Evil thoughts come out of the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so do stealing, false witness, and telling lies about others.  
 Those are the things that make you 'unclean.' But eating without washing your hands does not make you 'unclean.' " The Faith of a Woman From Canaan   
 Jesus left Galilee and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon.  
 A woman from Canaan lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon controls my daughter. She is suffering terribly."   
 Jesus did not say a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him, "Send her away. She keeps crying out after us."   
 Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."   
 Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him. "Lord! Help me!" she said.   
 He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."   
 "Yes, Lord," she said. "But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their owners' table."   
 Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! You will be given what you are asking for." And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand   
 Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.  
 Large crowds came to him. They brought blind people and those who could not walk. They also brought disabled people, those who could not speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.   
 The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were made well. Those not able to walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.   
 Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, "I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way home."   
 His disciples answered him. "There is nothing here," they said. "Where could we get enough bread to feed this large crowd?"   
 "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked.  "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."   
 Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.  
 He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples passed them out to the people.  
 All of them ate and were satisfied. After that, the disciples picked up seven baskets of leftover pieces.  
 The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.   
 After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat. He went to the area near Magadan. 
 Jesus Is Asked for a Miraculous Sign   
 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to put Jesus to the test. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.   
 He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be good weather. The sky is red.'  
 And in the morning you say, 'Today it will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what is happening right now.  
 An evil and unfaithful people look for a miraculous sign. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah."  Then Jesus left them and went away. The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees   
 The disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to take bread.  
 "Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."   
 The disciples talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."   
 Jesus knew what they were saying. So he said, "Your faith is so small! Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?  
 Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?  
 Don't you remember the seven loaves for the 4,000? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?  
 How can you possibly not understand? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."   
 Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to watch out for the yeast used in bread. He was warning them against what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. Peter Says That Jesus Is the Christ   
 Jesus went to the area of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"   
 They replied, "Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Still others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."   
 "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"   
 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ. You are the Son of the living God."   
 Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah! No mere man showed this to you. My Father in heaven showed it to you.  
 Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.  
 I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you unlock on earth will be unlocked in heaven."   
 Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus Tells About His Coming Death   
 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day rise to life again.   
 Peter took Jesus to one side and began to scold him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This will never happen to you!"   
 Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are standing in my way. You do not have in mind the things of God. Instead, you are thinking about human things."   
 Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must say no to himself. He must pick up his cross and follow me.  
 If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.   
 "What good is it if someone gains the whole world but loses his soul? Or what can anyone trade for his soul?  
 The Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory. His angels will come with him. And he will reward everyone in keeping with what they have done.   
 "What I'm about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom." 
 Jesus' Appearance Is Changed   
 After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James with him. He led them up a high mountain. They were all alone.  
 There in front of them his appearance was changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as the light.  
 Just then Moses and Elijah appeared in front of them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.   
 Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters. One will be for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."   
 While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud surrounded them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, and I love him. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"   
 When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell with their faces to the ground.  
 But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."  
 When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.   
 They came down the mountain. On the way down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you have seen," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."   
 The disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?"   
 Jesus replied, "That's right. Elijah is supposed to come and make all things new again.  
 But I tell you, Elijah has already come. People didn't recognize him. They have done to him everything they wanted to do. In the same way, they are going to make the Son of Man suffer."   
 Then the disciples understood that Jesus was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus Heals a Boy Who Had a Demon   
 When they came near the crowd, a man approached Jesus. He got on his knees in front of him.  
 "Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shakes wildly and suffers a great deal. He often falls into the fire or into the water.  
 I brought him to your disciples. But they couldn't heal him."   
 "You unbelieving and evil people!" Jesus replied. "How long do I have to stay with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."   
 Jesus ordered the demon to leave the boy, and it came out of him. He was healed at that very moment.   
 Then the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, "Why couldn't we drive out the demon?"   
 He replied, "Because your faith is much too small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there.' And it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."   
<.>
 They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men.  
 They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead."  Then the disciples were filled with deep sadness. Jesus Pays the Temple Tax   
 Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum. There the tax collectors came to Peter. They asked him, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"   
 "Yes, he does," he replied.  When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and fees from? Do they collect from their own sons or from others?"   
 "From others," Peter answered.  "Then the sons don't have to pay," Jesus said to him.  
 "But we don't want to make them angry. So go to the lake and throw out your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the exact coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."
